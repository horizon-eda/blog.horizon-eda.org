Since this blog is just static HTML, use one of these ways to write comments:
 - Start a topic on [Discourse](https://horizon-eda.discourse.group/)
 - Post to the thread on [mikrocontroller.net](https://www.mikrocontroller.net/topic/417908) (German)
 - Post to the thread on the [EEVBlog Forum](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/eda/horizon-eda-version-1-0!/new/)
 - Join the `#horzion` IRC channel on freenode

For bug reports or feature requests, [open an 
issue](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/issues). For general 
questions on usage, post on one of the forums listed above or join the 
IRC channel. Don't write me an email for these kind of inquires as 
others will probably benefit from the answer and discussion as well.
