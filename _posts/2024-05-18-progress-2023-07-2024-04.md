Welcome back! As you may have realized, Horizon EDA has seen less 
development activity in the last year than it did before. This is 
mostly due to me having started developing another CAD software - 
Dune&nbsp;3D a parametric 3D CAD. Go check it out on 
[dune3d.org](https://dune3d.org/). It greatly benefited from the 
experience I gained from developing Horizon EDA and reuses many 
concepts both in implementation and user interface. If you like Horizon 
EDA, I'm sure you'll like Dune 3D as well!

Compared to Horizon EDA using Gtk3 it's built with Gtk4 since it had 
the higher version number, i.e. longer time to deprecation and I wanted 
to know where Gtk is headed. I should probably write a blog post 
reviewing Gtk4, but it's safe to say that Horizon EDA will stay on Gtk3 
for the foreseeable future since porting it to Gtk4 will take a lot of 
time and effort and will ultimately result in a worse user experience.

With that out of the way, let's dive into what has happened since the 
last release.

## User layers

Even though it's still a fairly expensive process, every now and then 
users were asking they could do rigid-flex PCBs with Horizon EDA. Since 
I want Horizon EDA to be an enterprise-class PCB design tool, 
supporting rigid-flex seemed like an interesting challenge.

From a PCB layout tool perspective, this mostly means supporting layers inserted at 
arbitrary positions in the stackup for denoting features such as flex 
areas, rigid areas or stiffeners.

In Horizon EDA, layers are referenced by [hardcoded 
integers](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/blob/master/src/board/board_layers.hpp#L10).
Since these layer numbers are also used in the design files, 
they're effectively set in stone as any change to them would either 
break compatibility with older files or require fragile conversions. 
Back when defining the layer numbers I realized that and spaced them in 
increments of 10 so it'd be possible to insert layers in-between 
existing layers without changing existing layer numbers. Unfortunately 
I didn't have that much foresight when it came to the inner copper 
layer numbers though as they're numbered `-1`, `-2`, 
etc., making it impossible to squeeze extra layers in between them 
which is just what we need for flex PCBs.

To work around this, user layers are assigned numbers outside out of 
the board stackup ranging from `1000` to `1007`, allowing for up to 8 
user layers. Their position in the stackup is defined  by a 
newly-introduced position attribute that's a floating-point number, 
making it possible to put them anywhere in the stackup. This however 
required some refactoring in various places since it's now a layer's 
position that determines its place in the stackup and not just its 
number.

User layers can be added, removed and rearranged in the Stackup dialog:

The user layer types are aligned with what's defined in the ODB++ 
specification to simplify communicating design intent to board 
manufacturers.

## Selection enhancements

The true-and-tested interaction model for most interactive applications 
is selecting things and then doing something with them. Horizon EDA is 
no different in that regard. In some cases the first part of selecting 
the right things can get quite complicated.
To narrow down selectable items, Horizon EDA supported a selection 
filter since day 1. While that already helps a lot in dense multi-layer 
boards, there were still some rough spots left:

Holding down Ctrl always toggled items from the selection, making it 
very hard to just add or remove items from the selection. To improve on 
that, it's now 
configurable whether holding down Ctrl should toggle, add or remove 
items from the selection.

When making a complex selection, holding down Ctrl can become rather 
awkward and unergonomic, especially on laptops. To fix that, we've now 
got a 'sticky selection' option to invert the behavior of the Ctrl key so that the 
selection behaves as described above if it's not pressed.

Without sticky selection enabled, clicking anywhere without Ctrl held 
down clears the selection, potentially destroying a minute worth of 
tediously selecting things. Wouldn't it be nice if there was a way to 
undo and redo selection changes? With version 2.6 there is! The 
selection undo/redo buffer also comes in handy as way to recall past 
selections for moving a group of objects after something else has been 
selected.

All of these new options are available from the selection popover:

Thanks to Horizon EDA's unified editor, they're available in all 
editors from symbol to board.

## Improved wayland support

TL;DR: switching between schematic and board editor isn't broken on 
wayland anymore

About a year or so ago I finally moved from i3 on X11 to sway after 
people told me about waybar since sway's builtin bar doesn't support 
menus as they're used by the networkmanager applet which was 
deal-breaker for me.

Apart from pointer warping everything was working more or less as it 
did on X11. Only after a recent sway update, switching between windows 
such as by pressing `Tab` in the schematic editor stopped working and 
the to-be focused window only got highlighted. Clearly something was 
something wasn't working quite right to not trigger sway's focus 
stealing preventions since the schematic and board editor are separate 
processes.

In pretty much all major windowing systems there are mechanisms that 
prevent applications from stealing focus, i.e. making their window the 
active one if none of their windows has focus right now. To still allow 
a non-focused application to get the focus, the windowing system 
requires some proof that the request originated from an application 
that currently has focus.

On X11 this is accomplished by passing the timestamp from the 
triggering event to the other process for raising the window. On Windows this is even 
simpler by calling 
[AllowSetForegroundWindow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-allowsetforegroundwindow)
with the PID for the process of the to-be focused window which can then gain focus.

In wayland land, there is the [XDG 
activation](https://wayland.app/protocols/xdg-activation-v1) protocol. 
It works by creating a token in the currently-focused application and 
passing that token to the process that wants to raise its window. I 
tried directly calling the wayland API but didn't get very far since I 
couldn't get the required event serial from Gtk. After [asking on the 
GNOME discourse 
forum](https://discourse.gnome.org/t/cross-process-window-activation-on-wayland/20306) I got pointed
to APIs that superficially only seem to be concerned with application 
startup IDs, but actually do exactly what I want.

## New build system

TL;DR: Horizon EDA now builds using meson.

In March 2023 the PDF library [podofo](https://github.com/podofo/podofo/) Horizon
EDA uses for PDF output released version 0.10 that is API-incompatible to the
prior version 0.9. While this isn't a problem by itself, the way some distributions
such as Arch Linux handled it made it one. Instead of keeping `podofo` package
at the old 0.9 version and packaging the new 0.10 version as `podofo-0.10` or such,
they upgraded the `podofo` package to 0.10 and provided a `podofo-0.9` package with
non-standard include and pkg-config paths. Since I initially didn't want to spend the
effort of adding support for podofo 0.10 and maintaining two PDF export 
implementations, the build system now had to discover the right paths 
for podofo 0.9.

Since its early beginnings in late 2016 Horizon EDA was using plain GNU
make as its build system as that's all I knew back then. Over time, 
with the help of other people, it grew with the project's needs, 
supporting various Linux distributions, FreeBSD and Windows.

However, discovering include paths isn't something that's easily doable 
with make, so it was time to go shopping for a new build system. The 
contenders were:

 - GNU autotools
 - cmake
 - meson

GNU autotools was out early on since its main selling point of providing 
compatibility with mid-90s UNIXes isn't of any use to Horizon EDA and it's 
overly obtuse.

Cmake is used by by many C++ projects, but looking at some random
`CMakeLists.txt`, its syntax made no sense at all to me.

So meson it is. Many GNOME-adjacent projects switched to it from 
autotools in the past couple of years, so it can't be that bad I 
figured. Having significant usage on the Linux desktop also meant that 
downstream packagers will already be familiar with it and I'll be less 
likely to run into problems no one has seen before.

Despite I don't usually have the spoons for build system touching, 
getting started with meson was surprisingly easy and there was a good 
solution for all challenges I encountered along the way and felt much 
cleaner than plain old make. A+++ would buy again.

## New Forum

Due to inactivity, the Discourse forum at [horizon-eda.discourse.group](https://horizon-eda.discourse.group/)
was shut down. The new place to discuss all things Horizon EDA is [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/discussions/).

In case someone needs anything from the discourse forum, I have a full backup
in the form of an SQL dump.

## Version 2.6

Finally, [version 2.6 
"Luna"](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/releases/tag/v2.6.0) 
is out!
See [the 
changelog](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/blob/v2.6.0/CHANGELOG.md) for a list of
all enhancements and bugfixes included in this release.

Also keep in mind that Horizon EDA is mostly a one-person show 
that I run in my spare time, so bear with me if things take a little 
longer.
