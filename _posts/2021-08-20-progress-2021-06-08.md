# Arc selection

Being able to select what's on screen is essential to any 2D or 3D 
manipulation application, naturally Horizon EDA is no different in that regard. 
That's why it was one of the first things that got implemented after 
some basic drawing methods were in place.

To keep implementation complexity low and quickly move on to other 
aspects of the application, selection was accomplished by axis-aligned 
bounding boxes.

Unfortunately, this approach works least best for objects at a 45Â° 
angle such as tracks since the bounding box will be much larger than the actual object, 
so in [late 
2017](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/commit/d02a26faa71e45e4d101c36a91c524b3149b5272)
selection boxes were enhanced to be rotated bounding boxes.

Apart from a couple of minor enhancements, there haven't been any major 
changes to selection boxes since then as rotated bounding boxes work well for 
anything roughly rectangular.

Arcs however, weren't supported that well, as they poorly fit into a 
bounding box. Also, polygon arcs weren't selectable at all.

To improve on that, the selectables got enhanced to to be able to take 
the shape of an arc. As with bounding boxes, it's fast and easy to 
check if the cursor is inside of the arc. Similar to how arcs are 
rendered, the geometry shader emits a equilateral triangle that's 
turned into an arc by the fragment shader.

On top of that, polygon arcs are now selectable as well.

# 3D preview keybindings

As suggested by [matt-roberts](https://github.com/matt-roberts) in 
[issue 584](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/issues/584), the 3D preview now supports 
keyboard shortcuts for commonly used actions such as zooming/panning 
and switching between projections.

# Grid switching

There are many [good 
reasons](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/issues/592) for using more than one grid on a board, 
for example to cleanly route next to parts of metric and imperial 
pitch. Since I deemed supporting local grids wasn't worth the 
added complexity, we now have a way of quickly switching between saved 
grids.

Where to find it: Expand the grid settings in the top left corner and 
click on the button with the three dots. Use the select grid action to 
switch grids.

# Appearance of composite pads

One of the key differentiating features of Horizon EDA has always been 
that it doesn't have a concept of built-in pad shapes. Instead, each 
pad in a package is defined by a padstack. A padstack in turn is made 
up of primitive shapes (circle, rectangle, obround) and polygons. So 
instead of a built-in rectangular pad with rounded corners, there is a 
padstack consisting of two rectangles and four circles. As seen in the 
"before" screenshot below, they're also drawn as such, leading to a 
rather messy appearance, especially for layers drawn in outline mode.

[mentioning](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/eda/horizon-eda-version-1-0!/msg3590446/#msg3590446) this on the EEVBlog forum finally got me motivated to do 
something about it.

The key to achieving the desired result is not drawing the outline of 
objects if it is inside of a filled area. This is accomplished 
by [stencil 
testing](https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-OpenGL/Stencil-testing): In 
the first pass, only the insides of all objects making up pads are drawn 
and the stencil buffer is written to. In the second pass, all pads are 
drawn again and stencil testing makes sure that all fragments that 
fall inside of the areas that were drawn before are discarded. This 
ensures that there no outlines inside of the filled parts.

# Key hint popup

[free_electron](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/index.php?action=profile;u=446) suggested showing a list of 
key sequences after the user has pressed at least one key. Since that 
suggestion made sense to me, I went ahead and implemented it:

The popup only appears after a slight delay, so experienced users 
entering the entire sequence in one go don't get distracted by the 
popup appearing and disappearing a split second later.

# Plane priorities

The correct assignment of plane priorities has always been one of the 
less intuitive aspects of the application. To provide some explanation 
on what plane priorities are all about, the plane editor grew a help 
popover a while ago. The plane priority defines in which order planes 
get filled in. This is particularly important for overlapping planes as 
it decides which plane "wins" in the overlapping areas. It's also worth 
noting that planes of the same priority get filled in one go, so they aren't 
aware of each other as they're being filled. For overlapping planes, 
that means that the calculated fragments will overlap, leading to DRC 
errors down the road.

Plane priorities are also crucial for Gerber export. The Gerber file 
format doesn't really support polygons with 
holes in them as they're needed for planes. One way to achieve the 
desired effect is to draw a polygon with the polarity set to "light", 
erasing anything everything beneath it that has been drawn before. This 
means that that a plane existing inside a hole of another plane needs a 
higher priority since it'd otherwise be erased by the light polarity 
polygon used to draw the hole.

The topic of plane priorities recently gained my attention when [frmdstryr 
posted](https://horizon-eda.discourse.group/t/help-some-polygon-filled-areas-not-showing-up-in-gerber-file/80)
about planes not being filled properly in the exporter gerber even 
though showing up correctly in the board editor and 3D preview.

Upon investigating the design files, it became clear that they had run 
into an edge case I haven't yet thought of: Usually overlapping planes 
of the same priority will result in DRC errors as mentioned above. In 
this particular case however the plane was surrounded by track that 
prevented the surrounding plane's fragments from overlapping with the 
inner plane. In Gerber export, this then resulted in some of the inner 
planes not appearing filled as they were erased by the light polarity 
polygons of the surrounding plane.

Rather than relying on the user to get all of this right (and blaming 
them when they don't), we now have a 
new check that ensures all plane's priorities conform to the 
requirements described above.

On top of that, plane priorities were renamed to "fill order" in the UI 
as at least one user got confused about a lower priority number 
corresponding to a higher priority. I recall someone having suggested 
this before. 

# Automatically fix gitignore

The introduction of project pools results in every project containing a 
pool with the requisite SQLite databases. As they're only used for 
caching purposes, they should be included in the project's 
`.gitingore`. When creating a new project, the project manager already 
takes care of this. For projects migrated from version 1.4 or earlier, 
though it was up to the user to add the database files to the 
`.gitingore`.

To automate this tedious task, the project manager detects if a 
recommended line is missing from the `.gitingore` and offers adding 
them:

# Version 2.1

About 3 months after the release of version 2.0, it's time for a new 
release. Rather than adding exciting new features, [version
2.1](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/releases/tag/v2.1.0)
is mostly about incremental usability and discoverability enhancements.

# What's next

For quite some time now, people have been asking for 
hierarchical schematics. About equally as long, I've been thinking 
off-and-on about how to best go about implementing it. Once I made up 
my mind, I went ahead and implemented it over the course of about a 
month.

Even though the implementation is mostly done by now, I decided to not 
include it into this release so it receives some more testing by a 
wider audience. Apart from that, this results in version "H" 
bringing support for hierarchical schematics.
