# Panelisation

When making small boards, it's often economical to put multiple copies 
of the project on one panel to make best use of the available board 
size. In EDA tools without explicit support for panelisation this is 
usually accomplished by copy and pasting the the finished board or by 
use of tools that operate on the exported gerber data. This approach 
has the downside that last-minute changes to the board such as updating 
the silkscreen require the whole manual panelisation process to be redone.

As the first approach of copy/pasting the board inside the layout tool 
itself doesn't work in Horizon EDA due to the strong link between board 
and netlist, I decided it's a good idea to add support for proper 
panelisation.

Panelising an existing board in Horizon EDA now is a simple multi-step 
process:

 1. Create a new empty project and open the board.
 2. Use the \"Manage included boards\" tool to load the board(s) to be 
 placed on the panel.
 3. Place the included boards using the \"Place board panel\" tool.
 
The boards can then be arranged as one object each without the 
possibility of unintentionally modifying it. To update the included 
boards, either use the reload button in the \"Manage included boards\" 
tool or reopen the project.

For making it easier to draw the panel outline, the outline of included 
boards can be extracted using the \"Smash panel outline\" tool.

Additionally, the board editor has grown a new layer \"Outline 
notes\" for adding annotations such as text or lines to 
the exported gerber outline data. These can't be placed on the regular outline 
layer as it should only contain the actual outline polygons used for 
generating the board shape in 3D preview and STEP export.

To my best knowledge, this makes Horizon EDA the first free and open 
source PCB layout tool to have panelisation built in. 

# Polygon vertex selection

In hover select mode, the interactive manipulator automatically selects 
the smallest object under the cursor based on the area of its selection 
box. This works surprisingly well for regular objects, but didn't work 
so well for selecting polygon vertices as they have the same area (0 × 
0 = 0) as polygon edges (l × 0 = 0). 

To improve on this the `get_area()` method now returns the length of 
the nonzero coordinate, so that a vertex is smaller than an edge. Since 
all dimensions are calculated in nanometers, chances are very low that 
an object with width and height will return a smaller area than an 
edge.

# Tool renumber pads: circular renumbering

For quite some time we've had a tool to renumber pads in a zig-zag 
order as it's common among connectors. In the past month, the tool has 
been enhanced to support circular renumbering:

# Symbol editor enhancements

Recently, people were asking about automated creation of symbols from 
units. Since I didn't see much value in this as there's more to a well-designed symbol 
than placing inputs left and outputs to the right, I decided to take this as a suggestion to improve the symbol editor in 
various ways.

## Preview for autoplacing pins

To make it easier to place consecutive pins, the symbol editor supports 
placing pins based on the last and second to last pin by pressing the 
return key. To increase the discoverability and ease of use of this 
interaction, the place pin tool now shows a preview of the to be placed 
pin:

![pin preview](/assets/pin-preview.png)

## Autoplace all pins

Rather than pressing return as many times as there are pins, the place 
pin tool can now place all remaining pins by pressing the `p` key.

## Show bounding box

In most symbols, all pins should be placed on the edges of rectangle 
centered around symbol's origin. To help with this, the symbol editor 
has been enhanced to show the bounding box formed by the pins.

The bounding box is updated automatically while moving pins.

## Resizing symbols

Resizing a symbol to make room for more pins or for rearranging 
existing pins tends to be a laborious task that involves moving pins, 
the symbol's box and text. As all of this is governed by rather simple 
rules, the tool "Resize symbol" has been introduced that tries its best 
to keep things aligned:

# Outline layer in packages

Some parts make it necessary to include cutouts in the board to 
accommodate features of their package that would collide with the board 
otherwise. It's preferable to make these cutouts part of the package 
itself to ensure consistency.

To enable this, it's now possible to draw polygons on the outline layer 
in packages that'll also show up on boards. As the outline drawn in the 
package might need to be modified for use on the board, the outline can 
be smashed from the package and edited as needed.

# Enhanced touchpad navigation (PR [#352](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/pull/352))

As pointed out by user [anuejn](https://github.com/anuejn) in [issue 
#350](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/issues/350) it could be 
useful to use touchpad scroll gestures for panning rather than for 
zooming. Their PR added an option in the preferences to achieve this. 
To improve consistency with other applications, both trackpoint and 
touchpad panning use the same scroll directions as other scrollable 
widgets provided by Gtk.

While KiCad has an identically-named option, our implementation is 
superior in two ways,
both of which are enabled by Gtk's excellent input device handling:

 1. The option only applies to touchpads since Gtk can tell from which 
 device an event originated.
 2. We support fractional/smooth/pixel perfect scrolling, (finer 
 increments than provided by emulated scroll wheel clicks) resulting in 
 a much smoother panning experience since even small movements 
 translate to a panning motion.

# Pool cache monitor

In order to use a part after modifying it in the pool manager, it's 
necessary to update it in the pool cache if the part is already used in 
the project. As this step might not be obvious at first glance, 
especially for newcomers, I decided to improve on the situation.

To let the user immediately know if there's an item in the pool cache 
that has become out of date, the pool cache is  monitored for changes 
(triggered by pool updates and modification of the cached files) and 
its status is shown right in the project manager:

![pool cache status](/assets/pool-cache-prj.png)

The "Refresh list" button is still there in the pool cache window as 
the monitor doesn't pick up changes in cached 3D models.

Since we now have the current status (out of date / current / missing) of 
all items in the cache always available, implementing [Pitrsek's 
suggestion](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/eda/horizon-eda-version-1-0!/msg2978648/#msg2978648)
to show a warning when placing a part that's outdated in the 
cache got feasible.

![pool cache warning](/assets/pool-cache-warning.png)

Deciding when to display the warning message is a bit more involved 
than one might initially think as not only the part itself, but also 
one or more of the items (unit, symbol, etc.) making up the part might 
be out of date. To quickly find all dependencies of the selected part, 
the part browser uses a recursive SQL query. This list is then checked 
against the pool cache status. Clicking on the "Pool Cache" button will 
open the pool cache window with all out-of-date items preselected.

# Git add from pool manager

When adding a new part to the pool, it's sooner or later required to 
`git add` the part with all of its dependencies. To simplify this 
process and to make sure that no item is left behind, the Git tab 
in the pool manager grew a new button "git add with dependencies" that 
-- as the name implies -- stages the selected item and all of it's 
dependencies. Again, a recursive SQL query is used to quickly find the 
dependencies.

# What's next?

As outlined in the previous post, release 1.1 is due by end of this 
month, so don't expect too many new features until then.
