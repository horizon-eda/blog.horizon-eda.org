## Blind and buried vias

There are many advanced features a PCB layout tool may or may not 
have. While there are workarounds for some missing features, you're out 
of luck when you need blind or buried vias and your layout tool doesn't 
support them.

When starting the development of Horizon EDA, I explicitly decided to 
not support blind or buried vias to keep things simple and I didn't 
expect users to use a new and untested PCB layout tool to make 
expensive PCBs that need blind or buried vias.

As Horizon EDA matured, users started 
[asking](https://horizon-eda.discourse.group/t/buried-and-blind-vias/157/)
asking for blind and buried vias. This and them being one of the last 
non-workaroundable features missing, I set out to finally implement 
support for blind and buried vias.

The essence of blind and buried vias is that their hole doesn't go all 
the way through the board. To represent that, the `Hole` class got a 
new member that defines its span, i.e. its start and end layer. 
Previously, a (plated) hole implied connectivity across all copper 
layers, whereas it's now required to consider a hole's span to 
determine which layers it connects. The patch canvas used for design 
rule checks and 3D preview also required some [essential 
changes](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/commit/57007a0131083e8a73581b1c2e050a689267d5e3#diff-537254a4607fabe09ec1a3471fb0ad0cfe7f1a14cc8dcf0f988a956c6fe43fd1) since 
there are now patches that span multiple layers. Before the 
introduction of blind and buried layers, the only-multi-layer patches 
were plated and non-plated through holes. As an implementation 
shortcut, they were placed on the layer `10000` which lead to various 
implementation quirks to handle this special case. By using a 
`LayerRange`, single- and multi-layer patches are now handled in a 
unified way.

The ODB++ and gerber export naturally required changes as well to 
support individual drill layers for every span. Implementing this in 
the ODB++ export didn't require any changes to the user interface since 
an ODB++ job contains all required metadata to specify the span of dril 
layers. The gerber export however required some UI to specify the drill 
filenames similar to the layer filenames.

Overall, this 
[added](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/commit/57007a0131083e8a73581b1c2e050a689267d5e3) just a little less than 1000
lines of code.

## Via definitions

Before designing a board that uses blind and buried vias, one usually 
agrees on a stackup with the board manufacturer that specifies which 
via spans will get made. 

To reflect this in Horizon EDA, we now have the via definition rule to 
specify which kinds of non-through vias can be used.

See the [docs](https://horizon-eda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/vias.html) for how to use via definitions.

## Undo/redo enhancements

A while ago, I came across a nice 
[article](https://github.com/zaboople/klonk/blob/master/TheGURQ.md) 
about the problem that editing while redo is possible clears the redo 
stack. This felt very relatable and the article offered a fairly easy to 
implement a undo/redo redo behaviour that never loses anything, so I 
went ahead and 
[implemented](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/commit/f1c6797175ea586a6a9a38dd274613c867af51a3) it.
To use it, enable "Undo/redo that never forgets" in the preferences.

One of the nice aspects of developing Horizon EDA is that one can 
quickly go from "it'd be nice if…" to "that's nice" when it comes to 
features like these.

## Part, Entity and Unit editor enhancements

In Horizon EDA, parts can inherit from other parts to represent 
components that are electrically identical and only differ in some 
parameters such as MCUs with varying amount of memory. Up until now, 
there was no way in the UI to change a part's base part. Doing so can 
be convenient when creating a part that's a member of a larger series, 
but being too lazy to create the base part before creating the actual 
part. To simplify this particular use case, the part editor now can create 
a base part that's a copy of the current part and set the current part 
to inherit everything from the base part in one single action.

To keep implementation complexity low (i.e. laziness) the part, unit, 
and entity editors only supported updating the user interface from the 
to-be edited once on startup. This had to change for the part editor to 
support changing the current part to inherit everything from the base 
part. With this obstacle out of the way, adding undo/redo to the part 
editor became fairly easy. For consistency and completeness, the entity 
and unit editor now support undo/redo as well.

## Pin names search

Horizon EDA supports multiple functions per pin to properly represent 
multiplexed pin functions as they're common on MCUs. Since MCUs have 
many pins with many functions, it's a bit tedious to find the pin that 
has the right function in the select pin names dialog.
To make them easier to find, it grew a search bar.

![Screenshot of the pin name assignment dialog, searching for usb. Pins PA4, PA11 and PA12 are shown. In the alternate functions, USB is highlighted.](/assets/pin-name-search.png)

Adding the search was fairly simple, but highlighting the search string 
in the checkboxes took a 
[disproportionate](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/commit/b7030384ccd3b864d474129f2ff529c8c8b7b6c7) amount of code.


## Gerber plane export bugfixes

In the process of exporting a board to Gerber, Horizon EDA maps 
its drawing model to the one from Gerber and has to paper over the 
resulting impedance mismatches. For tracks, that's fairly easy as there 
are only so many ways of representing lines on a 2D plane.

For planes however, the situation is a bit more involved. In Horizon 
EDA, planes are composed of fragments. A fragment is a polygon with 
zero or more holes with the outline and holes defined by their contour. 
Gerber on the other hand, doesn't support polygons with holes. Instead, 
it supports polygons, regions in Gerber parlance, of light and dark 
polarity. A dark polarity region draws over everything that was drawn 
before and a light polarity region erases everything underneath it. So 
to represent a fragment with holes, Horizon EDA first draws the outline 
in dark polarity followed by the holes in light polarity.

While this seems simple enough for one fragment, this approach falls 
apart when a plane with a hole in it is surrounded by another plane and 
the surrounding plane has a fragment inside the hole of the first 
plane. The fragments would get added to the Gerber image in that order:

 - Outline of the outer plane
 - Hole of the outer plane
 - Fragment inside of the hole of the outer plane
 - Outline of the inner plane
 - Hole of the inner plane

The bug is that the hole of the inner plane erases the fragment of the
outer plane.

To resolve this bug, all fragments of all planes on a single layer get 
[processed by Clipper's polytree](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/commit/1c2c7134939a5ff9a1c1d875190c945cf7e37bf8) to correctly establish which fragment 
exists in which hole. Fragments are then drawn in such order that 
everything existing inside a hole gets drawn after the hole has been 
drawn using light polarity.


## Pool reload enhancements

Reloading the pool in the schematic, board or any other editor used to 
clear the undo/redo history since the pool items pointed to by the 
copies on the undo/redo stack are gone after clearing the pool to 
reload it.

To remove this limitation, all items from the pool are now handled as 
`shared_ptr`s so that they'll be around as long as needed and are not 
affected by clearing the pool.

## Select plane at cursor

While debugging the issues related to gerber export of planes, I 
frequently had a hard time figuring out which plane I was looking at. 
Since the computer has a less hard time figuring this out, there now is 
an action that selects the plane that's under the cursor.

## Version 2.5

Finally, [version 2.5 
"Kepler"](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/releases/tag/v2.5.0) 
is out!
See [the 
changelog](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/blob/v2.5.0/CHANGELOG.md) for a list of
all enhancements and bugfixes included in this release.

This took a bit longer than initially 
planned, but I really wanted to get blind an buried vias into this 
release and then got 
[distracted](https://github.com/carrotIndustries/redbook#readme) 
[by](https://github.com/carrotIndustries/sfp-extender) 
[various](https://chaos.social/@karotte/110392144723257733) 
[other](https://chaos.social/@karotte/110247453778513923) 
[projects](https://github.com/carrotIndustries/blinkenbike).

Also keep in mind that Horizon EDA is mostly a one-person show 
that I run in my spare time, so bear with me if things take a little 
longer.
