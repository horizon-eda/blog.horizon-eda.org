## Hierarchical schematics

### TL;DR just tell me where to find it

Open the schematic properties dialog either from the hamburger menu or 
by clicking on the three dots in the sheet list. There, click on the 
plus icon to add a new block.

### How it came to be

Ever since the beginning of Horizon EDA, I've had in mind to eventually 
support hierarchical schematics. So when I defined the format for 
project files, I made provisions for hierarchical designs by supporting 
multiple netlist blocks. Each block would then be edited in its own 
instance of the schematic editor.

Over the course of time people came back asking about hierarchical 
schematics and I thought off-and about how to implement it.

After pondering how multiple instances of the schematic editor 
would interact with each other, I came to the conclusion that having 
multiple instances of the schematic editor would be confusing and 
complicate attaining a good user experience. On the other hand, I still 
wanted each block in the hierarchy to have its own netlist and 
schematic file. In the original design, the names of these files would have 
been stored in the project file. This however would have been 
impractical as the the project file is written by the project manager 
and not by the schematic editor. Storing them in the top-level netlist 
also seemed the wrong thing to do.

That's why projects now have an additional file `blocks.json` storing 
the filenames for netlists, schematics and and block symbols.

With question of where to store things out of the way it came to teach 
the schematic editor how to edit multiple blocks. For that, I went with 
the same approach I took for editing multiple sheets by globally 
selecting which block is currently being edited. Back when I made that 
decision for sheets, that approach felt a little hacky, but worked 
out well without any bad surprises, so I felt comfortable 
doing the same for blocks.

Similar to virtually any other schematic entry tool 
that supports hierarchy, blocks are connected through ports, with one 
significant difference though. Instead of ports being separate objects 
with their own name, ports are defined by setting the "is port" flag on 
a net. I've always found it confusing when port names could differ from the 
net they're connected to.

To represent instantiated blocks on a sheet, each block is accompanied 
by a block symbol. To edit it, the schematic editor morphs into the 
block symbol editor. While this took more effort than creating a a 
dedicated block symbol editor, it yielded a much more consistent user 
experience.

With all of the infrastructure in place for editing blocks and block 
symbols, it became time to implement instantiating blocks to finally 
create hierarchy. This required a new way of storing component's 
reference designators and do not populate flags since one component 
can now go by multiple reference designators, depending on how often 
the block it sits in got instantiated. To do so, the top block contains 
a map of all instantiated blocks in the whole design in which each item 
describes the mapping of component UUID to reference designator and do 
not populate flag.

A similar problem cropped up for sheet numbers. In a flat design, one could 
directly look at a sheet's index to determine its page number. For 
hierarchical designs however, a sheet's page number also depends on the 
page count of instantiated schematic blocks that go before it, requiring a complete view 
of the design. Since that complete view isn't available in all places 
that require page numbers, they're computed and stored in the top 
schematic.

Non-top blocks can either be edited within or outside of the hierarchy. 
In the former case, the editor fills in the reference designators from 
the top block's instance map and takes care of saving any edits to 
reference designators and do not populate flags to the instance map 
rather than to the component itself. This creates the illusion of all 
instances of a block being kept in sync, where there's just one 
schematic with different reference designators filled in.

Net classes and power nets are global to all blocks to keep things 
simple and consistent. It's implemented by copying them from the top 
block to all non-top blocks.

The sheet list in the left sidebar that's been virtually unchanged 
since forever got extended to a tree that shows the hierarchy:

![ ](/assets/sheet-box.png)

The section below the separator line shows all non-top blocks, even if 
they aren't instantiated anywhere. Selecting the block (USB in the 
screenshot) itself switches to the symbol editor view.

A pathbar-like widget sitting above the schematic shows the current 
position in the hierarchy and makes useful tools more discoverable:

![ ](/assets/instance-bar.png)

I copied the styling of the pathbar from GNOME's [Dconf 
Editor](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/DconfEditor) for its pretty look. 

Apart from the schematic editor itself, other parts of the application 
such as annotation, BOM and PDF export also required enhancement to 
properly support hierarchical designs. For easy navigation in the 
exported PDF, the table of contents reflects the hierarchy and block 
symbols link to the corresponding sheet.

For use with the board editor, the hierarchical netlist is flattened by 
recursively expanding all instantiated blocks. This requires generating 
unique and predictable UUIDs for components and nets from instantiated 
blocks. For this purpose, version 5 UUIDs specified in [RFC 
4122](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122#section-4.3) 
come in handy as they describe how to derive UUIDs from arbitrary data. 
To compute a version 5 UUID, one prepends the input data with the 
binary representation of a namespace UUID, calculates its SHA1 hash 
which then gets truncated to 128 bits and has a couple of bits replaced 
to indicate the UUID version. In our case, the arbitrary data consists 
of the instance path, i.e. the list of all instance UUIDs leading to a 
particular component or net, and the UUID of the component or net 
itself. That way, the board editor only required minimal changes 
related to cross-probing.

All in all, this added [about 
6000](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/commit/16b925a3605fbac0f77c9b453131df6e3dda0ad0)
lines of code. At the time of this writing, Horizon EDA itself is 
slighly more than 140.000 LOC[^1].

## Align and distribute tool

Similar to the tools available in Inkscape, Horizon EDA can now align 
and distribute objects:

<video muted controls loop style="max-width:100%;">
  <source src="/assets/align.mp4">
</video>

Hovering over the buttons shows a preview of what's going to happen 
when clicking on it.

Where to find it: Select the items you want to move and search for 
align in the spacebar menu.

## Part prefix override

Some entities such as the ones for generic multi-pin connectors are 
supposed to be used for pin and receptacle headers. However, pin 
headers go by the "P" reference designator whereas receptacles use "J". 

To enable correct reference designators for these cases without having to duplicate the 
entity, parts can now override the reference designator prefix set by 
the entity:

## Shorted pads rule ([PR #629](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/pull/629))

*Thanks to [Erik](https://github.com/guserav/) for contributing this 
feature and this section.*

When designing single layer PCB 0 Ohm bridges are strictly necessary. 
As such they are considered components by Horizon EDA and thus they have to 
be added in the Schematic of the board you want to design. However 
Horizon EDA doesn't have a clue about the fact that the two pads of a 0 Ohm 
resistor can be considered shorted and shouldn't result in an airwire 
making the preflight airwire check kind of annoying to deal with on a 
board with more than 50 such bridges.     

To tackle this problem the easiest solutions would be to adjust the 
schematic such that both sides of a bridge are two separate nets. 
While working this would result in a hard to read schematic. Another 
solution would be to give the user the ability to place 0 Ohm resistors 
like vias on the fly while routing tracks. Whilst being quite a nice 
solution in terms of usability it comes with a whole string of issues 
when trying to implement. To name a few: Special handling to have it 
appear in the BOM, basically needing to reimplement the reference 
designator for silkscreen and component list, ...        

After a bit of thinking the best solution in terms of implementation 
effort and usability was to introduce the shorted pads rule which 
allows the user to specify a part or component to match and consider 
the pads shorted for airwire display. This allows the user to simply 
connect the 0 Ohm resistor with both pins to the net that should go 
through it at an arbitrary point in the schematic or even a different 
sheet.

## Exposed copper to silkscreen clearance ([PR #633](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/pull/633))

*Thanks to [Erik](https://github.com/guserav/) for contributing this 
feature and this section.*

While designing a very cluttered board I noticed that there was no 
check to indicate a silkscreen being on an exposed copper pad. This 
was especially funny as there was already UI to enable such a check and 
configure the clearance to use. As there was quite enough code on how 
to use clipper this was an easy fix.    

## Dark theme

Gtk's default (and only?) theme Adwaita includes a dark variant. On 
Linux desktop environments, there usually is an option to globally 
select the dark variant. On Windows though, Gtk doesn't automatically 
pick up the global dark mode setting.

To allow users to experience Horizon EDA the way they like, there now 
is a dark mode switch in the editor preferences.

Apart from that, the footprint generator's graphics are automatically 
recolored to match the current theme:

## Rendering performance improvements

[Robin's pull request](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/pull/615) 
and the subsequent discussion on IRC motivated me to have another look 
for low-hanging fruits to make rendering faster. Profiling with `perf` 
and hotspot yielded some opportunities for easy speed improvement, 
mostly focused on avoiding reallocations:

[Use a `std::vector` rather than a 
`std::list`](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/commit/e77623774a5e2bc287a10a068e4a7e8f86ddc3ec) to store the 
transformation stack since pushing and popping from a vector won't 
incur memory reallocations once the vector has grown to a sufficient 
size.

The placement class contains fast paths for 90 degree rotations as 
these can be done without sine/cosine computation. [A missing `else` 
in an `else 
if`](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/commit/56358df96761f7a75aebef5854b4fb905167c253) caused it to take the slow path for the trivial 0 
degree case, oops. I only spotted this since the sine computation 
showed up bigger in the flame graph than expected.

A missing [`&` near 
`auto`](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/commit/fa2a6d4a206c40de4692b5263908f274278cdda8) caused a vector to get copied every time a 
single character was rendered.

Each line of text is rendered into an intermediate buffer before being 
drawn onto the canvas so that its extents can be determined beforehand 
as it's necessary for right-aligned text. Due to laziness, that buffer 
got 
reallocated on each line.
[Moving that 
buffer](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/commit/987724c79949204b095990db0fae6349dabe1ac) to the Canvas, where it's only 
allocated once got rid of some reallocations.

## Undo/redo popups

Using undo and redo sometimes left me wondering about what I just 
undid. The first step into fixing this was storing the name of the 
current tool in the undo history. Once that was done, adding an overlay 
that appears on undo/redo was [fairly 
straightforward](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/commit/ecab1deea642c2f138b8a97a61c9e9fb27dbf604).
The overlay briefly disappears if it is still visible during the 
subsequent undo/redo action to indicate that a new action was 
triggered.

## Sorting pool items by modification time

When creating or placing a new part, one often needs to use other items 
that just got created or modified. To simplify this, the pool browsers 
in the create part dialog are now sorted by modification time. Since 
there's no visible modification time column, sorting my modification 
time can be selected by right-clicking the column headers:

## Windows specifics

For for stock information and GitHub integration, Horizon EDA talks to 
the outside world over HTTPS using curl and libgit2.
Both of these use OpenSSL for TLS by default. On Windows, it 
requires shipping a certificate bundle of all root certificates. This 
is far from optimal for two reasons:

1. Users need to trust Horizon EDA to not ship a malicious root CA 
certificate that could be used to intercept the application's 
communication with the internet.

2. Users sitting behind a corporate MITM proxy that terminates TLS and 
re-signs it with a certificate that's trusted by Windows aren't able to 
use the aforementioned features since the cert isn't trusted by the 
certificate bundle that ships with Horizon EDA.

While the first issue is mostly of theoretical importance, I know of at 
least one user being affected by the second one.

Rather than trying to convince OpenSSL to use the Windows certificate 
store, I found out that both curl and libgit2 can use Windows' crypto 
infrastructure instead of OpenSSL, if compiled with the right options.
For curl this was as easy as as substituting the MSYS2 package 
`mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-curl` for `mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-curl-winssl`. 
For libgit2 however, such package didn't exist so [I had to make 
it](https://github.com/msys2/MINGW-packages/pull/9746). With these 
changes in place, I could finally 
[remove](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/commit/6994969a25ac22395b7abf0dd0b29bf191b7c50c)
the certificate bundle and the Windows-specific code to locate it.

## Security enhancements

### SQL injections

Talking about SQL injections with a friend made me realize that parts 
of Horizon EDA are vulnerable to them. In almost all places, where 
user-supplied data is used in SQL queries, this is done using parameters, making SQL injections 
impossible. For the definition an usage of parametric tables however, 
user-supplied strings are used in SQL queries by means of string 
concatenation since table and column names can't be supplied as 
parameters, opening the door for SQL injections. This means that a 
maliciously-crafted pool or project could run arbitrary SQL statements 
to exploit a [vulnerability in 
SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/cves.html). To prevent this, user-supplied table and column names are 
validated to only contain word characters, that is lower and upper case 
letters, numbers and underscores.

### Inter-process communication

Horizon EDA uses ZeroMQ over local TCP sockets for inter-process communication 
between the main application `horizon-eda` and editor `horizon-imp`. 
Port numbers are assigned randomly on startup and passed to editor 
processes through environment variables. Due to the nature of TCP 
sockets, every other application running on the same computer could 
connect to and interact with Horizon EDA through these sockets after 
guessing the port number. This isn't a problem for applications running 
as the same user as Horizon EDA as these wouldn't gain any additional 
privileges by interacting with Horizon EDA.

Applications running as a different user though could gain access to a 
running instance of Horizon EDA.

To protect against this, the pool/project manager creates a cookie in 
the form of a UUID on startup. It is provided to the editor processes through an 
environment variable. Requests on the IPC socket are only accepted if 
they contain the correct cookie. This doesn't change the situation for 
processes running as the same user as Horizon EDA as these can just get 
the cookie by inspecting `/proc/<pid>/environ` of an editor process. 
Processes running under a different user though don't have access to 
the cookie and are thus prevented from making valid requests. The same 
applies for web applications, though I'm not sure how far one will get 
by using HTTP or web sockets talking to ZeroMQ.

## H is for hierarchy

Now that hierarchical schematics have been sitting on the master branch 
for a few months, it's about time for [version 2.2 
"Halo"](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/releases/tag/v2.2.0). 
See [the 
changelog](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/blob/v2.2.0/CHANGELOG.md) for a list of
all enhancements and bugfixes included in this release.
