## Checks improvements

Some users brought up that checks were taking excessively long on their 
medium-sized board of about 630 components, so I had a look at what 
could be done to make them faster.


### Copper clearance check speedup

By far the most time-consuming check is the copper clearance check as 
it has to check almost every copper feature against every other one. It 
does so by offsetting one by the clearance and then calculating the 
intersecting polygon. Since quite some time now, these checks are being 
done in parallel to speed things up.

This however left an important optimisation on the table. Offsetting a 
patch takes significant time on its own, but is being done over and 
over as patches are checked against each other. To only offset patches 
once, the copper clearance check now works like this:

 1. Get patches on copper layers
 2. Calculate bounding box of each patch (done in parallel)
 3. Figure out patch pairs, i.e. which patches need to be checked against each other
 4. Determine which patches need to be expanded by their clearance
 5. Expand patches by clearance  (done in parallel)
 6. Check each patch pair for whether its patches intersect

After discussing this with [Erik](https://github.com/guserav/), he came 
up with a [pull 
request](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/pull/650) that 
implemented this along with a couple of other optimisations. While the 
pull request was functional, I had difficulty reasoning about its 
correctness since it made extensive use of the 
[struct-of-array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AoS_and_SoA#Structure_of_arrays)
idiom. Doing so required indexing different vectors with no 
compile-time guarantee that an index is used for its intended vector.

While bugs in most parts of Horizon EDA are annoying at worst, the 
copper clearance check is one of the 
areas where bugs can really ruin one's day by not catching rule 
violations that could result in non-functional boards.

To make it 
easier to reason about the check's correctness I implemented a [vector 
wrapper](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/blob/20cfd7d74ed985f126b5d946c591f5f10b50a7c8/src/util/named_vector.hpp)
that supports [strong index 
types](https://www.fluentcpp.com/2016/12/08/strong-types-for-strong-interfaces/) and removed some premature 
optimisations that had little measurable performance impact. The vector 
wrapper ensures at compile time that an index can only be used with the 
intended vectors.

All in all, these optimisations reduced the time it takes to run the 
checks on that particular board from 8 minutes to about 2½ on my 
machine.

### Cancelling checks

Even more annoying than checks taking excessively long was that there 
was no way to cancel them other than forcibly terminating the editor, 
potentially losing unsaved work.

There now is a button to cancel running checks and trying to close the 
rules/checks window also cancels any running checks. Cancelling is 
implemented by means of an atomic bool variable that's set from the UI 
thread and some `if (cancelled) return;` statements sprinkled over the 
checks.


### Check cache mutex thinko

Since most of the board checks need the board flattened into a set of 
polygons (patches) grouped by net, layer and patch type (pad, track, 
etc.), that computation is supposed to be done once and used by all 
checks. As all checks run in parallel, the cache is guarded by a mutex:

```c++
RulesCheckCacheBase &RulesCheckCache::get_cache(RulesCheckCacheID id)
{
    if (!cache.count(id)) {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> guard(mutex);
        switch (id) {
        case RulesCheckCacheID::BOARD_IMAGE:
            cache.emplace(id, std::make_unique<RulesCheckCacheBoardImage>(core));
            break;
        /*other IDs*/
        }
    }
    return *cache.at(id);
}
```

I initially put the mutex inside of the `if` since checking if the id 
is already present in the cache shouldn't require holding a mutex. Thinking about it while writing this blog post, I came to the 
opposite conclusion since another thread could have put the `cache` map 
into an inconsistent state while emplacing a cache.

 This 
however didn't result in the intended behaviour. Initially, the id 
isn't in the cache, so all checks requesting any cache id will fall 
into the `if` and try to grab the mutex. Whichever is first acquires the 
mutex, creates the cache of the requested id, adds it and eventually 
releases the mutex. Then, the next check will acquire the mutex, 
create the cache, which is then immediately discarded since it's 
already added.

Instead of each cache being calculated once, it gets calculated over 
and over sequentially for each check!

After recognising this rather embarrassing bug, [fixing 
it](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/commit/90520520992f852548d846fcc1801da101e7fd7b) was as simple 
as hoisting the the lock guard to the very top of the method. That way, 
the first check to acquire the mutex calculates and adds a particular 
cache and the subsequent checks then find the cache to be there already 
once they acquire the mutex.

### Check status polling

After starting the checks, I noticed that the user interface was 
getting unresponsive, which came as a surprise since the checks are 
running in threads outside of the main UI thread. Attaching a profiler 
and staring at the code revealed that the checks were calling a 
dispatcher into the main thread for every status update which 
eventually stalled it. 

To prevent this from happening, the main thread now periodically polls 
the the check status.


## More schematic checks

For most of their existence the schematic checks have been rather 
bare-bones as they only checked for single pin nets. In addition to 
that, there are now checks for

 - single label nets, i.e. nets that only have one net segment with a 
 label attached
 - unconnected pins
 - unconnected ports

## Direction on alternate pin names

Ever since day 0, pins supported [multiple 
names](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/blob/429222a46c13928b8b6da8323c0378c7b0a2028f/pool/unit.hpp#L27) to 
accurately describe multi-function pins as they're commonly found on 
microcontrollers. As it comes with features that are there early on, 
there's always the chance of them not being as well thought out as they 
should have been. In this particular case: 

 - Alternate names can't specify direction different from the primary 
 name
 - Alternate names are referenced only by index, making it hard to 
 reliably reference them in schematics
 
To address both of these shortcomings in one go, alternate names are 
now referenced by UUID (as everything else) and also carry a direction. 
This also brought us a nicer editor for alternate names:

![ ](/assets/alt-dir.png)

## German umlauts

Horizon EDA uses the [Hershey fonts](/misc/2019/11/17/fonts.html) to 
draw text in everything from symbols to boards. While they contain a 
number of non-ASCII glyphs such as µ and Ω, they're missing German 
umlauts which is rather unfortunate as many users are German-speaking.

The hershey fonts are stored in a rather idiosyncratic format that 
encodes numbers as ASCII characters relative to `R` and ends up looking 
a lot like line noise. Naturally, there's no editor for it. So I hacked up a 
really ugly python script that converts between the hershey font 
format and SVG paths, to use Inkscape for modifying glyphs. By 
pasting the dot from an i on top of a/o/u and integrating them into the character 
set, texts now support umlauts. This still leaves the ß, but 
designing that to fit within the well-made hershey fonts is beyond my 
skills.

![ ](/assets/umlauts.png)

## Non-modal text editing

As all tools, the "Place text" one started out using modal dialogs that 
block all other interaction as they're easier to implement. Now that 
the interactive manipulator also supports non-modal dialogs in tools, I 
decided it was about time to use them to enable a richer text editing 
experience: 

![ ](/assets/edit-text.png)

Every change in the dialog is instantly reflected in the text object 
being edited.

## 3D preview animations

To make the transitions triggered by the view all/top/bottom/etc. 
buttons less jarring, these are now smoothed by animations. Same as the 
smooth zooming, they use a mass-spring-damper system simulation for 
interpolation.

## Non-blocking 3D preview rendering

Opening the 3D preview for the medium-large board I got handed to have 
look at the checks, I also noticed that opening the 3D preview was 
blocking the UI unacceptably long.

Instead of the application becoming unresponsive, there now is a pretty 
loading bar:

<video muted controls style="max-width:100%;">
  <source src="/assets/layer-load.mp4">
</video>

On top of that, the layers making up the 3D preview are rendered in 
parallel.

## Plane update progress indication

Another improvement that came out of the board I got handed is that 
plane updates don't lock up the user interface anymore. Updating all 
planes on that particular board blocked the user interface for 30 
seconds with no way of cancelling.

To stop the UI from locking up, planes are now updated in a background 
thread. During that time, the editor grabs all keyboard and mouse 
input, preventing modifications to the board.
If the plane update takes longer than 2 seconds, a dialog that provides 
progress indication and a way to cancel the the plane update pops up. 

This still leaves the possibility for plane update to take 2.1 seconds 
which will lead to the dialog flashing up just for a split second, 
leaving the user puzzled if they missed anything. 

As that's not a good user experience either, the board editor stores if 
the dialog was shown for each board and plane and immediately shows the 
dialog if it was shown in the last plane update. That way, it's ensured 
that the dialog is always visible long enough to be properly recognized 
by the user.

## 3D mouse support

A while ago, a friend found a [DLR](https://www.dlr.de/rm/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-3808/6234_read-8998/) 
[SpaceMouse](http://spacemice.org/index.php?title=Spacemouse_Classic)
in the attic. Much to our surprise, it's still supported by 
[spacenav](http://spacenav.sourceforge.net/) out of the box with very 
little configuration, which is quite impressive considering that it's 
almost 30 years old. A quick test with the included sample applications 
confirmed that it's indeed working.

Naturally, the next thing was to add support for it in the 3D preview. 
The API provided by libspnav couldn't have been any simpler: Connect to 
the spacenav daemon, retrieve the file descriptor and call the method 
to poll for events whenever data is available on the file descriptor. 
All that's left to do was to feed the received deltas into the 
animators for the corresponding axis to provide some smoothing. 
All of this took [less than 100 lines of 
code](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/commit/30951a4d77827de90dc21317f33f227c2407b5c8#diff-7be725fb328b3668ca9b6a5a12916b17c3488417bcbfdd87de7b5c3eaa78fd6d).

All in all, the feature isn't all that useful, but very fun to play 
with!

## Thermal rules and spoke customisation

Motivated by [Issue 
618](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/issues/618), I had a go at 
adding more flexibility to thermal relief generation in planes. In 
addition to specifying the connection style, i.e. solid or thermal 
relief in the plane itself, we now have thermal relief rules that can 
override the connection style based on component, pad, layer and net. 

While I was at it, I also added support for specifying the number of spokes and 
their angle. 

## Marker improvements

### Filtering

When checks result in many errors, the board can get quite crowded 
with error markers and error polgons. To reduce clutter, there now are 
several ways to selectively hide them.

The checks page of the rules window grew a checkbox to only show 
markers that belong to the currently active layer. This also applies to 
the error polygons drawn on the board to make it easier to tell which 
layer an error polygon relates to.

Also, collapsing a rule in the error list now hides its markers and error 
polygons on the board.

### Tooltips

While double-clicking an item in the list of errors centers the marker 
on screen, there hasn't yet been a way to find out which error a marker 
is indicating. To solve that, markers now have tooltips that show their 
reason for being there. 

![ ](/assets/marker-tooltip.png)


## Net ties

Every now and then, people were asking for ways of joining two nets on 
the board in one place, such as analog and digital ground. Rather than 
relying on a workaround based on components, there now are proper net 
ties.

See [the 
docs](https://docs.horizon-eda.org/en/latest/imp-sch.html#net-ties) for 
how to use them. I now came to realize that documenting the use of new 
features in the blog isn't optimal for discovery and keeping the 
documentation up to date, so they're now documented where they should 
be.

## Offset pad connection

For some pad shapes, not connecting the track to the pad origin can be more 
practical. To support this, while still having the track logically 
connect to the pad there now is the "Move track connection" tool. 

See [the 
docs](https://docs.horizon-eda.org/en/latest/imp-board.html#offset-pad-connection) for 
how to use it.

## Board connectivity check

Up until now, the only check to make sure that all copper features of a 
net are properly connected was the preflight check checking for 
airwires. With the addition of the offset pad connection feature 
however, there could be cases where a track doesn't connect to a track 
physically even though it's connected logically.

To catch these kinds of errors, there now is the board connectivity 
check that checks that all copper features of a net are actually 
connected. Most of this check was fairly straightforward to implement by 
constructing a graph where nodes are copper polygons with zero or more 
holes and and edges are PTH holes and checking how many connected 
sub-graphs there are. Properly supporting connections made by the 
shorted pads rule took a disproportionate amount of effort as the shorted pads rule 
operates on pads (as the name implies) whereas the check operates on 
polygons that don't know if they originated from a pad or something 
else.

This is a good example how complexity can be multiplicative. Features 
don't exist in isolation, so when adding new ones, one also has to 
make sure that they work well with what's there already. 

## ODB++ output

Unless you're going to etch your PCBs at home, you'll need to send the 
board layout to a PCB manufacturer to get them made. The traditional 
format for this purpose is Gerber. Originally intended as language to 
drive photo plotters (think G-Code), it turned more and more into a 
data exchange format.

Apart from Gerber, the only other format that has seen significant use  
is ODB++ as far as I'm aware. The [wikipedia 
article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ODB%2B%2B) provides a good 
overview on its history and origins.

Some time ago, I've been approached by users about adding ODB++ output 
to Horizon EDA since they wanted to import a board they designed into 
a power integrity simulation application that only supported importing 
ODB++. By skimming the specification, I deemed that exporting ODB++ was 
feasible to implement. However, it's always helpful to have a sample 
file at hand to verify one's understanding of the specification. As I 
couldn't find any back then, I 
[asked](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/eda/odb-sample-files/) on the 
EEVBlog forum, but then found more important or fun things to do.

This topic regained my attention when other people also voiced interest 
in ODB++ export on the 
[forum](https://horizon-eda.discourse.group/t/odb-support-in-horizon-eda/104).
Another factor contributing to implementing ODB++ export was me being 
curios about the format and how it compares to Gerber. There's 
certainly no better way to learn about a file format than to implement 
software the writes it.
Checking the [ODB++ 
website](https://odbplusplus.com/design/our-resources/#documentation) 
once more, I was happy to see that there's an ODB++ sample design 
available for download. Equipped with the specification, a sample file 
and the ODB++ viewer running perfectly in Wine, everything was there to 
start implementing ODB++ output.

Similar to Gerber, a single ODB++ job is made up of multiple files in a 
specific directory structure. Canonically, they're packed up as a tarball. 
To not litter the code with messy file system operations for creating 
files and directories as needed, I introduced a 
[`TreeWriter`](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/blob/20cfd7d74ed985f126b5d946c591f5f10b50a7c8/src/export_util/tree_writer.hpp) class
that provides an easy to use and hard to misuse interface for the task 
and enforces semantics that are compatible with writing to archives 
such as only one file being open at once and not re-opening a file 
after another file was opened.
It comes in two variants: One that writes to the file system 
and one that uses [libarchive](https://www.libarchive.org/) for 
directly writing to a tarball or a zip archive.

The central part of an ODB++ job is the matrix. It's in 
`matrix/matrix`. I had some difficulty 
grasping its purpose initially, but here's my understanding: ODB++ 
supports multiple designs in a single job for panelisation. Each 
individual design is called a "step" in ODB++. Rows in the matrix 
represent layers and each step is its own column.

| Layer↓  / Step →  | Design A | Design B |
| ----------------- | ---------| -------- |
| **Top copper**    | layer image | layer image  |
| **Bottom copper** | layer image  | layer image |


The cells of the matrix are then image of each layer for each step. The 
image for each layer is described by the `features` file in the 
`steps/<step name>/<layer name>` subdirectory file. The overall drawing 
model is similar to that one used by Gerber, though it carries less 
state. In Gerber, one first selects an aperture of certain size and 
shape (think pen) and then uses it for drawing lines or pads. 
In ODB++, the pen is called symbol and specified by the line itself 
rather than being kept in global state. ODB++ specifies a range of 
built-in parametrizable symbols for common shapes such as circles or 
rectangles. Since specifying the entire symbol name for each line would 
be wasteful in terms of file size, each symbol is assigned a unique 
integer. Lines and pads then reference the symbol by that 
integer rather than its name. For those familiar with X11 or Win32, 
this is the same concept as atoms on these platforms.

Custom symbols, as they're needed for more complex 
padstacks, are also supported. They're defined by the `features` file 
in `symbols/<symbol name>`. As you might have guessed from the file 
name, they use the same format as the layer image itself. This is much 
nicer than Gerber's aperture macros which for example don't support polygons with 
rounded edges at all. Upon re-reading the Gerber spec, I discovered 
that it supports so-called "block apertures" since 2015 that can make use of the 
drawing primitives available for the board.



To represent planes and polygons, ODB++ uses surface records. These 
consist of one (or more, though not recommended) contour describing the 
outline of a polygon and zero or more contours for the holes within the 
outline. A contour is made up of straight lines and arc segments, a 
good match for polygons in Horizon EDA. Gerber on the other hand as no 
notion of holes within polygons. To add a hole inside of a polygon 
(region in Gerber parlance), one switches the polarity to light, 
effectively erasing everything that has been drawn in the area of the 
hole.

Surfaces are also used for defining the outline (profile) of the board 
in the `steps/<step name>/profile` file. The board's profile is 
supposed to be made up of one surface with one outline contour and zero 
or more hole contours. This makes it necessary to determine which 
polygons on the outline layer are holes and which ones aren't. For the 
3D preview and step export, this was accomplished with clipper by 
applying an odd-even fill rule. For the ODB++ export this wasn't an 
option though since clipper can only deal with polygons with straight 
contours and outputting arcs approximated by line segments is 
outline polygons by finding a polygon that encloses all others.
inaccurate. So I wrote [some 
code](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/blob/20cfd7d74ed985f126b5d946c591f5f10b50a7c8/src/board/board.cpp#L1339)
that tells apart holes from outline polygons. This also directly benefited 
the STEP export (see below) and yielded a check that makes sure that 
the board outline complies with these requirements.

With all of that implemented, the ODB++ export was about on par with 
the Gerber one.

The next step was to add nets. Nets are stored in the `steps/<step 
name>/eda/data` file. Each net then has records that point to the 
features defined for each layer by index. That way, features are 
assigned the net they are connected to.

Other than nets, the `steps/<step name>/eda/data` file also contains 
outlines for packages and their pads or toeprints, as they're called in 
ODB++ parlance. These packages are referenced by the `components` file 
on the special layers `comp_+_top` and `comp_+_bot` to indicate the 
position of components.

Throughout the ODB++ job, attributes can be attached to features, 
layers, nets and other objects to add supplemental information such as 
if a pad is a via or an actual pad or specifying a net's net class.

Overall, the ODB++ export added about 3000 lines of code and took 
roughly one month of off-and-on coding. Having implemented both Gerber 
and ODB++ output in Horizon EDA, I can say that both are adequate 
formats for exporting PCBs for manufacturing. On To be fair to Gerber, 
right now, the ODB++ export is more featureful as in knowing about 
nets and components than the Gerber export since I haven't implemented 
the relevant parts of the Gerber spec yet and not because Gerber 
doesn't support them. This is mostly due to the Gerber export having 
been implemented about five years ago back when the rest of Horizon EDA 
was much less mature and the only goal was to have something to get 
the application off the ground with no effort spent on any bells and 
whistles.

Last but not least, Horizon EDA is now listed as [ODB++Design 
Development Partner](https://odbplusplus.com/design/partners/). To my 
best knowledge, Horizon EDA is the first free and open-source PCB design tool 
to implement ODB++ output.

## View at actual size action

Many times after receiving boards I designed, I was surprised to see how 
small they actually are. To get a better idea of their true size, we 
now have the "View at actual size" action that sets the zoom level such 
that one millimeter on the board corresponds to exactly that on screen. 
This relies on Gtk knowing the monitor's size and resolution, which 
worked great on my computer so far.

## Reflowing tool bar

When introducing [configurable key bindings in 
tools](/progress/2020/08/29/progress-2020-07-08.html#configurable-key-bindings-in-tools)
the tool bar showing the available keys got a visual upgrade in the way 
of giving the keys a more distinct appearance. This however has the 
downside that list of keys now is a box that just clips its content if 
the available width is insufficient. Previously, the list of keys was 
one long label that reflows into multiple lines in that case.

What's needed to solve this is a container that reflows its children 
similar to how a label reflows words. Since Gtk doesn't have such a 
container built in and [asking on the GNOME 
forum](https://discourse.gnome.org/t/container-that-reflows-its-children/6279)
also didn't yield anything useful, I had to roll my own container.

With the help of 
[DzlColumnLayout](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libdazzle/-/blob/master/src/widgets/dzl-column-layout.c)
which does something similar and the [Gtkmm custom container 
example](https://developer-old.gnome.org/gtkmm-tutorial/3.24/sec-custom-containers.html.en)
I managed to 
[implement](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/blob/e9b326d2c0e00876404d55af9afb3f0fb1c25d90/src/widgets/reflow_box.cpp)
a container that fit my needs. While I'm not 100% confident that I got 
everything of Gtk's intricate geometry management system right, the 
container seems to work well enough:

## Improved board outline in STEP export

Exporting a board whose outline includes polygons with arcs, it occured 
to me that I was lazy back then and the STEP export flattens arcs in 
the board outline into line segments. Since the I was working on the 
ODB++ output in the meantime, I realized that the hard work of figuring 
out which polygons represent the outline and which ones represent holes 
was already done, so all that's left to do was to convert the polygon 
representation of Horizon EDA to the one from Open CASCADE. As usual 
Open CASCADE's documentation on [that 
topic](https://dev.opencascade.org/doc/refman/html/class_b_rep_builder_a_p_i___make_edge.html) left a lot to be desired.
Have a guess which overload's needed to make a wire in the shape of an 
arc. Fortunately, KiCad's step exporter does handle arcs the right way, 
so I could use their 
[implementation](https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/blob/5bf163de80bb8b7e0a21de84f0af39d5a22f0631/utils/kicad2step/pcb/oce_utils.cpp#L1663)
to figure out how get Open CASCADE to do the right thing.

## Version 2.3

With all of these improvements and new features, the time is right for  
the next release, [version 2.3 
"Iceblink"](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/releases/tag/v2.3.0). 
See [the 
changelog](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/blob/v2.3.0/CHANGELOG.md) for a list of
all enhancements and bugfixes included in this release.
