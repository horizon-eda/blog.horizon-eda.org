The development that took place in the last two months mostly focused 
on streamlining the part creation and review process.

# Pull request review bot

It all started with opening [an 
issue](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon-pool/issues/169) 
discussing about how to make it easier to get parts merged in to the 
horizon-pool repo.

One of the major obstacles in reviewing pull requests was that the 
process of checking out the PR, updating the pool and having a look at 
each item was rather laborious. To alleviate this, I had the idea of a 
bot that posts a summary of all items in the PR to the comments so one 
doesn't even need to leave GitHub.

The initial plan involved triggering a GitHub action every time the 
pull request is updated. This however is complicated by the fact that 
the bot needs access to the `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret for posting the comment,
but actions triggered by PRs run the workflows defined in PR, so can't 
be trusted with secrets. Fortunately, GitHub actions [had just gotten a 
new event 
type](https://github.blog/2020-08-03-github-actions-improvements-for-fork-and-pull-request-workflows/)
that runs the workflow files from the PR's target, so the workflow gets 
handed the secrets required for posting comments. In the end, I didn't 
need any of this since I figured it's more convenient to trigger the 
bot by posting a comment with a specific trigger phrase.

Another detail that didn't pan out as devised was implementing the bot 
in Python based on the [Python 
module](https://horizon-eda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python.html) as 
that'd have involved exposing all of the pool items' internal details 
such as a Unit's pins in the Python API. I didn't really feel writing 
tons of glue code to accomplish this, so I wound up implementing the 
bot in C++.

For easy use in GitHub actions, it's packaged as a [docker 
image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/horizoneda/horizon-pr-review).
At the time of writing, it's [based on the yet-to-be-stable Debian 
bullseye](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/blob/master/Dockerfile-pr-review)
as the copy of osmesa that's packaged in buster is broken due to [a bug 
that got fixed 
upstream](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=109659#c4) over 
a year ago. I wanted to file a bug in the debian bugtracker, but got 
demotivated by the overly complex process.


As described earlier on, [the 
workflow](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon-pool/blob/master/.github/workflows/review.yml)
is triggered by a comment beginning with the trigger word `Bot!`. To 
avoid pulling the docker image on every comment, even if it's on an 
issue, the workflow is divided into two jobs. The first job checks if 
the comment matches the trigger word using a fork of the 
[Khan/pull-request-comment-trigger](https://github.com/Khan/pull-request-comment-trigger) action.
The second job that pulls and runs the docker image thus only runs if 
the bot was triggered.

The [bot 
itself](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/blob/master/src/pr-review/pr-review.cpp)
then updates the pool that got pulled by the workflow script and uses 
libgit2 to figure out which files got changed in the pull request. 
Through some rather lengthy recursive SQL queries it prints a list of 
changed items and their relationships.

For each item that's part of the PR, it'll print all of its details 
that are necessary for determining whether it's fit for being merged 
into the pool repository. To help this, the bot also runs checks to 
automatically point out common mistakes.

To aid visual review of symbols and packages, the bot includes a rendering of the item in 
its output. Unfortunately, GitHub's API doesn't support attaching 
images to comments, so I had to host the images externally. The first 
approach that came to my mind was to use an S3 bucket and cloudflare 
as I've read about that combination as a cheap way to host static 
content. After trying to set this up, I decided this wasn't for me due 
to excessive complexity of AWS and cloudflare only being available for 
top level domains. Rather than this rube-goldberg contraption of 
multiple cloud services, the bot uses [another 
repo](https://github.com/horizon-eda/poolbot-media/) that it pushes to 
using a deploy key.

For the in-pad text rendering in packages, I resurrected the code that 
renders the in-pad text using vector fonts. That code was used in the 
board editor until it got replaced by the more efficient 
[MSDF](https://github.com/decimad/msdf-atlasgen)-based rendering.


# More checks

Initially, all of the checks for Units, Entities and Parts were locked 
up inside the PR review bot, meaning that people opening PRs will only 
get feedback once the bot has run. To give instant feedback instead, I 
decided to move these checks into the common code that's used by both 
the pool manager and the bot.

## Unit, Entity, Part

All of these editors grew a "Checks" button in the header bar that 
provides live feedback on the check status.

## Symbol

To take some of the manual work out of reviewing Symbols, the Symbol 
editor got support for checks as well. These check for correct placement 
of pins and text among other things.


# Improved GitHub authentication in the pool manager

Since its inception, the remote tab in the pool manager that simplifies 
submitting PRs to the horizon-pool repo without having to use git made 
use of password-based authentication. Since I wasn't comfortable with storing 
passwords persistently, users had to reenter their password 
every time they submitted a PR.

Needless to say, that this is far from good user experience, especially 
since it didn't work well with two-factor authentication 
enabled. The final push to to improve this situation was GitHub announcing to [turn off
password-based API access near the end of 
2020](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-14-deprecating-password-auth/).

So I had a look how other tools that also use GitHub's REST API handle 
authentication. The GitHub desktop app uses 
[OAuth](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/developers/apps/authorizing-oauth-apps#redirect-urls)
with the redirect URL being a custom protocol that's handled by the 
app. Since I didn't want to rely on protocol handlers as these might 
not be set up correctly if the user is running Horizon EDA directly 
from the build directory without installing it, that option wasn't for 
me.

A few months back, [GitHub CLI 
1.0](https://github.blog/2020-09-17-github-cli-1-0-is-now-available/) 
made the news, so I was curious how it does authentication. Trying it 
out and having look at the sources revealed that it uses the 
[OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization 
Flow](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-07-27-oauth-2-0-device-authorization-flow/).
Compared to regular OAuth, this doesn't need any protocol handlers and fits the bill in 
other aspects as well, I set out to to add implement it in the pool 
manager:

After clicking the login button in the pool manager, the user receives 
a one-time code.

![one time code](/assets/gh-dev-code.png)

Once having entered the code on the page linked in the login window, 
they'll get the standard OAuth authorisation page:

![one time code](/assets/gh-dev-auth.png)

Access to workflows is required since the forked pool repo also 
contains workflows.

A few seconds after authorizing the pool manager, the pool manager 
receives the OAuth bearer token and the user is logged in:

# Support for updating PRs

Another nuisance about the remote tab in the pool manager was that 
there was no easy way of updating pull requests. This has somewhat 
bothered me for the entirety of its existence, but I couldn't come up 
with a robust way of implementing it. For creating PRs, the pool 
manager maintains a clone of the forked pool in the `.remote` directory 
and copies items into it as needed. Updating a PR then could involve 
any arbitrary action such as removing, renaming or adding files to the 
existing PR branch.

After mentioning this in a [pull 
request](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon-pool/pull/156#issuecomment-695357053),
in the pool repository, [Stephanie](https://github.com/RX14) suggested 
on IRC to create a new commit and force push that one to get around the 
difficulties of updating an existing branch. As this idea seemed 
reasonable to me, I started thinking on how to implement it and came up 
with a way that doesn't require force pushes. Explaining it requires 
diving a bit into how git works internally:

Even though most git interfaces show commits as diffs, each commit is 
in fact a complete snapshot of all files in the repository, represented 
by a so-called tree object. Thanks to git's content-addressable storage, a particular version file is only 
stored once and can be referenced by more than one tree. Tree objects 
get created from the contents of the index (staging area) when 
committing. Usually, the working directory and index contain the files 
of the commit that'll be the parent of the to-be created commit and the desired changes.

However, nothing's preventing us from using the files from a different 
commit as the starting point for our changes. When updating a pull 
request, the pool manager finds the merge base for the PR 
branch and the master branch to get the commit the PR is based on. 
It'll then check out this commit, copy the files the user wants to 
merge, adds them to the index and writes a tree object from the index. 
This three object is used to create a commit whose parent is the latest 
commit on the PR branch. That way, we always start from a known-good 
state and only get the changes the user intended to do without having 
to worry about renames and the like.

# Version info in files

The on-disk json format has been continuously evolving along the 
application to support new flags and features. These changes were 
always done in such a way that it's always possible to open files 
created with an older version. However, when saving a file, it'll 
always be saved in the latest format. Opening and then saving such a 
file in a prior version will then lead to the details not supported in 
that version to be erased from the file.

To prevent this from happening and to alert users about converting a 
file to a newer version, we now have per-file version information and 
the [issue](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/issues/280) for it
is finally closed. It's important to note that the version stored in 
the files relates to the version of the file format itself, not directly to 
the version of Horizon EDA the file was created in. This allows for 
more fine-grained alerts since these will only appear if a newer 
version of the application actually made changes to the file format.

When saving a file will upgrade its version this is what the user will 
see:
![version update](/assets/version-update.png)

If the file was created in a newer version, it's opened read-only:
![version ro](/assets/version-ro.png)

The learn more link leads to [the 
documentation](https://docs.horizon-eda.org/en/latest/version.html) on 
the versioning scheme.

To be honest, this should have been in there at least since version 
1.0, but oh well. Alt least we can now implement things such as [adding 
directions to alternate pin 
names](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/issues/521).


# Version 1.3.0

As per the [release schedule](https://blog.horizon-eda.org/misc/2020/03/26/release-schedule.html),
version 1.3.0 got released on 2020-10-29. See the 
[changelog](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/blob/v1.3.0/CHANGELOG.md)
and this and the prior progress reports for features that made it into the 
release. The list of new features is a bit shorter than usual since the 
pull request review bot isn't part of the released application.
