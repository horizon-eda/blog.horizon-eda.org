The last month's progress report was mostly about enhancements of the 
python module. This month instead, development was focused on the user 
interface. Apart from that, Horizon EDA got submitted to [Hacker 
News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23062174)
(not by me) and made it to the frontpage on May, 4<sup>th</sup>.

As to be expected, this lead to a significant spike in visitors to the github repo 
(there are no stats for <nobr>horizon-eda.org</nobr>).

## Progressive model loading in 3D preview

Ever since the 3D preview supported showing 3D models, waiting for them 
to load was an exercise in patience as there was no progress indication 
whatsoever, apart from the spinner animation which itself is an 
euphemism of the hourglass icon from the '90s.

To shorten the perceived loading time, the models are now shown right 
after they've been loaded and the loading indicator grew a progress 
bar. Since low-complexity models such as resistors and capacitors 
usually account for the majority of packages on a board, it's 
desirable that these get loaded and shown first. This is 
accomplished by sorting the models by file size, hoping that small 
models will load faster than larger ones. Tests with real-world boards 
proved that this works surprisingly well.

## Scale bar in preview canvas

People suggested adding a bar scale to package previews to get a better 
sense of size of the thing they're looking at. As this seemed like a 
good idea to me, I went ahead and implemented it. The bar only updates 
with a slight delay as updating it while the smooth zoom animation 
is running lead to some visually distracting effects since the scale 
bar first grew bigger but than snapped back to a smaller size as it 
switched to another scale.

## Shortcuts in context menu

After finding out that I could just pack a `GtkBox` inside a 
`GtkMenuItem` to show two labels in a menu item, showing shortcuts in 
the context menu was [a piece of 
cake](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/commit/3441ff5ae7015e3e9e9e8d729c68b2f927e712b8).

## Minimum line width in canvas

On IRC, [Robin](https://github.com/rroohhh) suggested adding an option 
for setting the line width for zero-width lines. Luckily that idea was 
in my stash of things I might do if someone other than me thinks it's 
worthwhile. Since we have antialiasing, fractional line widths are 
supported as well.

## Part wizard in parts tab

Since its inception, the part wizard button was located in the packages 
tab because the first step in creating a part with the wizard is 
selecting a package and I was to lazy to add a package selector to the 
wizard back then.

This however wasn't quite optimal from user's perspective since the 
part wizard clearly belongs to the parts tab, so it gained a another 
step to select the package and its button got moved where it belongs.

## Redesigned unit and entity editors

Motivated by [Tim's usability 
feedback](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/issues/390), I had a 
go at revamping the unit and entity editors that both haven't seen much 
development in their existence. 

The unit editor now uses a tabular layout rather than repeating the 
headers every row. The swap group option got removed since pin swapping 
still isn't implemented and is unlikely to make it in the near future. 

![unit editor](/assets/unit-editor.png)

To make it easier to locate pins in the unit editor when editing a 
unit's symbol, it gained support for cross-probing in that way, that the 
selection in the unit editor follows the selection in the symbol 
editor.

The entity editor followed suit:

![entity editor](/assets/entity-editor.png)

As it's show in both screenshots above, the editors now have built-in 
help explaining the purpose of fields that aren't immediately obvious.

## Gate swapping

When redesigning the entity editor I was faced with the decision of 
either removing the gate swap option (similar to the unit editor) or 
finally implementing gate swapping. I chose the latter, so we now have 
gate swapping! 


## Resizeable tool popover

The tool popover's size can now be adjusted by dragging its lower 
border. The implementation is a bit hacky since popovers don't support 
interactive resizing out of the box, but works surprisingly well if the 
popover opens downwards.

## Reload netlist hint

To remind (new) users to reload the netlist in the board after saving 
the schematic, the board editor now shows a popver when the schematic 
got saved:

## Action bar

By far the biggest change that happened this month was the addition of 
the action bar that makes commonly-used tools more discoverable.

![action bar](/assets/action-bar.png)

Less-often needed actions are accessible from menus that can be 
opened in three ways:

 - Clicking on the arrow in the bottom-right corner of the button
 - Right-clicking on the button
 - Clicking on the button and dragging to the right
 
The whole thing is loosely inspired by blender's toolbar that appeared 
in version 2.8. Special thanks go to [@atoav](https://github.com/atoav) for the 
ideas and suggestions provided in [the 
issue](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/issues/119).

## Redesigned preferences

Sparsely populated pages in the preferences window got merged into a 
new "Editor" page:

![new prefs](/assets/prefs.png)

This was triggered by the addition of the action bar since adding a 
new page for just two switches seemed a bit silly.

## KiCad symbol import

To make use of KiCad's extensive symbol library and symbols provided by 
manufacturers, Horizon EDA now supports importing KiCad symbols. 
Importing a symbol provides all information necessary for creating 
unit, symbol and entity. When specifying a package during import a part 
with the pad mapping taken from the symbol will be created as well.

Even though (almost?) all data from the symbol is used, there are still 
some things the user needs to do such as repositioning pins.
The import is handled by a wizard similar to the part wizard:

After picking the library file, the user gets to select the symbol 
they'd like to import:

![kicad sym 1](/assets/kicad-sym-1.png)

The next step then is to pick a package. This is simplified by 
filtering based on the number of pins in the symbol:

![kicad sym 2](/assets/kicad-sym-2.png)

Finally, the part, entity, etc. are created and the user gets a chance 
to review and complete these:

![kicad sym 3](/assets/kicad-sym-3.png)

## View options menu

To make useful options such as selection filter, airwire filter and 
bottom view more easily discoverable, the view hints label in the status bar 
grew a menu:
