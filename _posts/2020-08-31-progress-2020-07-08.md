Since not that much happened in July and I was busy at the end of that 
month, the July and August progress reports got merged into one.

# Length tuning window enhancements

Based on suggestions from [robin](https://github.com/rroohhh) and 
[anuejn](https://github.com/anuejn), the nets in the length 
tuning window can be sorted by length and the length tuning tool takes 
its reference from the one set in the length tuning window.

# Configurable key bindings in tools

By far the biggest change in the last two months was the introduction 
of configurable key bindings in tools. Ever since the beginning, tools directly received 
keys being pressed. This meant that the key bindings used in tools were 
set in stone with no way to change them other than recompiling the 
application. This is a bit unfortunate, as some key bindings such as 
slash for changing track posture are easy to reach on US keyboard layouts
but are difficult to press one-handed on german layouts. So I decided 
it was about time to fix this.

This was accomplished by the introduction of in-tool actions: Rather 
than directly sending the keys pressed to the tool, the key presses 
will get resolved to in-tool actions by the interactive manipulator, 
so the tools only need to know about the in-tool actions. To make 
things simpler to implement, mouse clicks also get translated to 
in-tool actions.

The in-tool key sequences are configurable in the preferences, similar 
to the regular key sequences:

Since the tool bar that show the key bindings available in the tool 
required modification anyhow, it also got a visual upgrade that makes 
the key bindings more easier to see:

The biggest effort in this change was porting all ( >80 ) tools over to the 
in-tool actions without introducing any bugs. In that process, 
superseded tools such as the non-KiCad router got removed.


# Drag to bend net lines

It's good practice to keep all net lines on schematics either 
horizontal or vertical. For straightening non-axis-aligned net lines, 
there's always been the bend net line tool. Inspired by LTSpice's 
schematic editor, this tools now gets activated automatically when 
dragging such a net line.

# Improved pool item delete dialog

Deleting items from the pool can cause other items that depend on the 
deleted item to break. To make this more clear to the user, the 
deletion dialog in the pool manager now lists all items that depend on 
the to-be-deleted item:

# Parts window

Faced with assembling a new revision of the [Hubble main 
board](https://github.com/carrotIndustries/hubble/#main-board) for 
reflow soldering, I needed something similar to the [Interactive HTML 
BOM](https://github.com/openscopeproject/InteractiveHtmlBom) for 
efficiently placing components. As people have been sending me links to 
this very project and asking for something similar to be added to 
Horizon EDA, I took the opportunity to implement it. [Less than 250 
lines of 
code](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/commit/8619bb06ffd600b26e82694b75aba52e1c42d059) later,
this is what we've got:

![parts window](/assets/parts-win.png)

Selecting a part in the list will highlight it in the editor as well as 
in the 3D preview. The tickbox in the parts list doesn't do anything 
other than being there to make it easier to remember having placed a 
particular part. 


# Version 1.2

As per the [release schedule](https://blog.horizon-eda.org/misc/2020/03/26/release-schedule.html),
version 1.2.0 got released on 2020-07-29. See the [changelog](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/blob/v1.2.0/CHANGELOG.md)
or the prior progress reports for features that made it into the 
release.

Unfortunately, [Issue #453](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/issues/453)
turned out to be more than a glitch caused by cosmic rays. As I wasn't 
able to reproduce this issue and couldn't come up with a reasonable 
explanation for the behaviour observed by the reporter, that issue didn't 
make any progress towards a fix for a few weeks. Only after more people 
reporting the same bug and finding out that the flatpak package for 
version 1.2 was affected as well, things started to look more and more 
as if the bug depends on compiler versions.

As it turned out, the code that hashes UUIDs for use in 
`std::unordered_map` triggered undefined behaviour due to shifting an 
`int` (32 bit) by more than its width. That undefined behaviour went 
unnoticed on more recent versions of GCC.

Release 1.2.1 addresses this bug by casting the value to a type of 
sufficient width before doing the bitshift.


# Debian packages

Even though Debian-based distributions such as Ubuntu are quite 
popular, there hasn't been an easy way of installing the latest 
released version of Horizon EDA on that family of distributions.

To improve on this, we now have the
[horizon-deb](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon-deb) repository 
that contains the `debian/` directory and a GitHub Actions workflow to 
automatically build Debian packages for Debian Buster and Ubuntu 18.04 
and 20.04.

The built packages are published on 
[bintray](https://bintray.com/horizon-eda) as a Debian repository for 
[convenient installation and 
upgrading](https://horizon-eda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#debian-ubuntu).

# Decals

People have been asking off-and-on how to put logos and such on their 
boards with Horizon EDA. Other PCB layout tools use packages/footprints 
for this, but that has a couple of drawbacks:

 - In Horizon EDA, a package on the board requires a component in the 
   netlist and thus also a symbol in the schematic
 - Packages aren't scalable, so there will have to be multiple copies 
   of the same thing at multiple sizes

To address this request once and for all, I decided to introduce a new 
object type, called Decals. Decals are stored in the pool similar to 
packages for convenient management. Opposed to packages, decals don't 
contain pads and are limited to copper, soldermask, silkscreen and 
assembly layers. Once placed on a board, decals can be scaled to fit 
the board's space requirements:

# KiCad router integration enhancements

Even though the KiCad Push&Shove router has been part of Horizon EDA 
for over two years, there are still some features that are missing the 
required glue code to make them work. Among them were the "highlight 
collisions" and "free angle" mode as well as allowing for DRC 
violations.

Triggered by [a post on the EEVBlog 
Forum](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/eda/horizon-eda-version-1-0!/msg3180540/#msg3180540)
I went ahead and 
[added](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/commit/078d54340f4ccaa8cb1718d10780265a01cc803f)
support for these modes to the routing tool, so 
its settings window now looks like this:

# Discourse Forum

An Email conversation with [Alex 
Forencich](https://github.com/alexforencich) and users using GitHub 
issues for non-issues made it evident, that there's the need for 
a proper discussion platform since IRC isn't really searchable 
long-term and the threads on the mikrocontroller.net and EEVBlog forums aren't 
suited for in-depth discussions.

Since other open-source projects such as GNOME adopted 
[Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) as a forum platform, I figured 
it can't be that bad and applied for their [free hosting for OSS 
projects](https://blog.discourse.org/2018/11/free-hosting-for-open-source-v2/)
and got approved promptly. Thanks to them, we now have a Discourse 
Forum at 
[horizon-eda.discourse.group](https://horizon-eda.discourse.group/).
