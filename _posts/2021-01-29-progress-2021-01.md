# 3D preview enhancements

To improve the appearance of models in the 3D preview, these are now rendered using 
interpolated normals. Additionally, shading now takes gamma correction 
into account, resulting in a more realistic appearance:

The background gradient is also rendered gamma-correctly. 
The outer portion of the image shows the incorrect 
gradient, as it was rendered before. The center portion is rendered 
correctly with the blending being done in linear color space. Mixing 
red and green actually produces yellow rather than brown.

# Canvas rotation

When assembling or debugging boards, I often wished I could see the 
board on screen whatever way I was holding it. While the "bottom view" 
option took care of flipping the board to the other side, I still had 
to rotate the board in my mind. Since I don't like doing things my 
computer could to for me and I know how to make computers do things, 
Horizon EDA now supports rotating the board (and package) view by 
arbitrary angles:

The hard part implementing this was getting the box selection and grid 
to work correctly regardless of the current angle.

# Improved thermals generation

For more than [three 
years](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/commit/e5f0cd73bab1f3431f11e4175f19f119abd58636)
planes supported using thermal spokes for connecting pads as way to 
improve solderability. However, certain circumstances could lead to the 
generated spokes being closer to other copper objects than specified in 
the rules. This was due to the thermal spokes being generated after the 
polygon was expanded to account for the minium width rule. To fix this, 
thermal cutouts and spokes are now computed before the minium width 
constraint is applied. Furthermore, the plane with added thermal spokes 
is clipped to the original plane without spokes to protect against 
spokes poking out of the intended plane outline.

# Measure tool

I've found myself using dimensions for measuring distances and deleting 
them right after I got the reading. As this is quite cumbersome, 
there's now a tool explicitly for measuring distances:

# Symbol expand preview

To accommodate pin names of varying length, symbols can be set to be 
expandable in the schematic. That way a symbol's width can be adjusted 
in the schematic to avoid overlapping text. Even though this feature existed 
for [more than 2 
years](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/commit/eba853ec89bef60b4bfc477e13f4735a9ca131d7)
it wasn't really obvious how to use it as various pull requests from 
users indicated. To be fair, there wasn't much explanation given what 
the "can expand" switch does and when to set it.

There now is a help button next to the switch that explains its 
purpose:

Additionally, the preview button opens a window that allows the user to 
see what the expanded symbol will look like:

# Pool download progress reporting

Testing the pool download on a computer running Windows showed that 
progress reporting was inadequate as checking out the cloned repo and 
copying took quite long with no visual feedback other than a spinning 
circle. To give the user more to look at, the pool manager now shows a 
progress bar for download, checkout and copy operations:

# Version 1.4

As per the [release schedule](https://blog.horizon-eda.org/misc/2020/03/26/release-schedule.html),
version 1.4.0 got released on 2021-01-29. See the 
[changelog](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/blob/v1.4.0/CHANGELOG.md)
and this and the prior progress reports for features that made it into the 
release. 

Apart from the usual set of new feature this release includes two 
important bugfixes for windows users:

 - No more laggy rendering on Intel GPUs
 - 3D preview doesn't crash randomly with "gl error 1285"

# What's next

[A 
comment](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon-pool/issues/169#issuecomment-765152730O)
on the future of the horizon-pool repo issue got me thinking what could 
be done do make it easier to mix-and-match pools. Even though I haven't 
quite decided yet on how to evolve the horizon-pool repo, it's 
definitely worth replacing the pool cache by a pool to make it easier 
to use multiple pools in a project. That'll also solve some consistency 
issues such as the results in the part browser not reflecting the state 
of the pool cache.

Apart from that I did some experiments for selecting packages in the 3D 
preview. Selection by itself is working, but there's still some integration 
and cleanup work left to be done.

When creating packages for parts with a complex outline such as 
connectors I often use FreeCAD to create a 2D projection of the part 
and import it into the package editor as a reference for drawing the 
outlines. To make this possible in Horizon EDA, I implemented a 
proof of concept based on Open CASCADE's hidden line removal algorithm 
that dumps the lines to text file to be visualized with gnuplot. When 
done, the package editor will be able to load these lines as an overlay 
that can be used to draw the package's outlines.
