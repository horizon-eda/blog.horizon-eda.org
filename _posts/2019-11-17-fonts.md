Back in late 2017, when writing the first implementation of the canvas 
(still in C, this was before the project transitioned to C++), there 
was the need for text rendering. The easiest way to render text in a 
vector-based application is to use a vector font where each glyph is 
made up of straight line segments. Opposed to proper OpenType/TrueType 
fonts, these have the advantage that they're easy to scale and are 
guaranteed to scale as intended, as I've observed that at least two 
schematic editors using TrueType fonts failing to scale text 
proportionally to the rest of the schematic resulting in text 
overlapping other content depending on the zoom level.

After some searching around for a suitable vector font, I stumbled upon 
the [Hershey fonts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hershey_fonts). Apart 
from looking pretty, they support quite a wide range of non-ASCII 
characters, unfortunately no German umlauts though. The glyph data is 
available in a rather strange format that encodes coordinates in the 
ASCII value of characters relative to the character `R`.

Since I didn't want to reinvent the wheel as that'd also involve 
manually mapping ASCII values to glpyh indices, I've had a look for 
implementations that'd be easy enough to adapt for my needs and finally 
found the [text rendering code from OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/modules/imgproc/src/drawing.cpp#L2051)
to be the best fit. As of today, the
[text rendering code in Horizon EDA](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/blob/master/src/util/text_data.cpp)
has very little resemblance with the code from OpenCV apart from the 
ASCII-to-glyph mapping tables.

There are still quite a few Unicode 
codepoints that have a corresponding glpyh in the Hershey fonts, but 
haven't been mapped yet. The PDF linked in [this post](http://scruss.com/blog/2014/05/02/forgive-me-a-v-hershey/)
gives a great overview of what's available  in the font. 

Only later I discovered that the Hershey Fonts are widely used among 
other EDA software as well, including but not limited to (Add ® and ™ 
as needed)

 - Cadence Virtuoso
 - Mentor Graphics Expedition PCB
 - Mentor Graphics DxDesigner
 - Keysight ADS Layout
 - P-CAD

One of the easiest way to spot the Hershey fonts is the glyph for 
`1` as the upper-left part is distinctively shaped (bent, not a 
straight line):

Also, the availability of odd script, cursive and 
gothic variants is a strong indicator for the usage of Hershey fonts. 

Now that you know how to spot the Hershey fonts, open a pull request if 
you've found other CAD software using them as well.
