## Curved tracks

KiCad adding support for curved tracks in version 6.0 motivated 
me to update Horizon EDA's copy of their router to also support 
curved tracks and benefit from other developments that happened since the last time I 
updated it. As always, updating the router is a somewhat daunting task 
since it's not a library with with a stable API, so its interface can 
change in arbitrary ways between releases and there's no documentation 
apart from the code itself.

One particular annoying aspect of integrating the version 6 router was that it now 
also uses the excellent clipper library for polygon operations, but 
with different compile-time options. To prevent the two copies of 
clipper from clashing with each other, I had to put the one for the router in 
a different namespace and prefix all `define`s.

Adding curved tracks in itself wasn't all that difficult and resulted 
in a diff of [less than 500 
lines](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/commit/05c31efabccd3496a44f61e2eaccf2ab1cb0e230).
It also greatly benefited of past enhancements for 
[rendering](https://blog.horizon-eda.org/progress/2021/01/07/progress-2020-11-12.html#improved-arc-rendering)
and 
[selecting](https://blog.horizon-eda.org/progress/2021/09/06/progress-2021-06-08.html#arc-selection) arcs.


## Cursed footprints

Apparently, there are technical reasons for some parts to require 
footprints as complicated as this one:

![ ](/assets/sic437.svg)

The above drawing is from the 
[datasheet](https://www.vishay.com/docs/75921/sic437.pdf) of the SiC437 
buck converter. 

Using this part in a project was good opportunity so 
see how hard it is to draw such a footprint in Horizon EDA and what 
could be done to make it easier. See the [newly-added 
section](https://docs.horizon-eda.org/en/latest/cursed-footprints.html) 
in the docs for tips on dealing with such footprints.

As it so happens, this exact part was [featured](https://twitter.com/engineer_bob_sz/status/1557998689800441856) on the [Cursed 
Footprint](https://twitter.com/CursedFootprint) Twitter account shortly 
after I used it.

## Schematic keeps labels on unconnected nets

A common way of creating connectivity in schematics is copy/pasting net 
labels from one place to the other. In that process, the net label may 
not be connected to any component. In Horizon EDA, a net label not 
connected to anything loses its net as the net assignments are derived 
from the components the label is connected to.

To fix this, net labels now remember the last net they were connected 
to so this way of creating connectivity also works in Horizon EDA's 
schematic editor.

## Vertical tool bar

While the introduction of the [reflowing tool 
bar](/progress/2022/05/04/progress-2022-01-04.html#reflowing-tool-bar) 
prevented the bar from overflowing the resulting layout still was 
suboptimal for tools with many actions such as the router:

There now is an option in the editor preferences to show the tool tip 
below the keyboard shortcuts:

# BOM format customisation

Similar to the Pick&Place export, the BOM export now supports 
customising the column names to suit the requirements of assembly 
houses.

## Prompting for filenames for new items

When creating a new symbol, padstack or package, the pool manager first 
prompted the user for a filename before opening the empty editor rather  
than directly opening the editor and allowing the user to decide on the 
filename later on. This implementation was a remnant of the very early 
days of the project back when the pool manager didn't exist and the 
editors had to be launched from the command line with an existing file.

To still keep the overall architecture similar, but allow the user to 
pick the filename after opening the editor, the pool manager now 
creates a temporary file and opens the editor with it. The editor 
then deletes the temporary file and asks the user for the filename when 
saving the new item for the first time.



## Part browser for assigning parts

Motivated by [Issue 
#682](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/issues/682), the 
schematic editor now uses the part browser window for assigning new 
parts to components. While there has been the "Assign Part" button in 
the part browser for a long time, it wasn't very discoverable and 
didn't provide any meaningful feedback when trying to assign a part to 
a component of the wrong entity.

The new "Assign Part" action temporarily reconfigures the part browser 
to only show parts of the matching entity and double-clicking a part 
will assign it to the selected components rather than placing it.

## Datasheet links in PDF export

Clicking on a symbol in a schematic PDF now takes one directly to the 
datasheet for the part.

## Design reuse

Inspired by the [EDeA](https://blog.edea.dev/introduction/) project, I spent 
some time thinking about how to simplify design reuse and sharing in 
Horizon EDA. After experimenting with block-level design reuse by 
importing an entire project as hierarchical block, I deemed it's 
easier to implement and of use to more people to improve design reuse by copy 
and paste. 

### Copying pool items

While copy/pasting schematics from one project to another was possible 
for a very long time, all parts, symbols, etc. used in the copied 
schematic had to be present in the destination project's pool. If they 
weren't the paste tool would crash.

To prevent this, the paste data transferred between source and 
destination schematic now includes the required pool items and the paste tool 
checks if all of them are available in the project pool. If that's not 
the case, the paste tool copies all required items to the project pool 
and triggers a pool update. Once the pool update is done, the paste 
tool resumes its normal operation.

Apart from pasting subcircuits such as DC/DC converters from other 
schematics, this new capability can 
also be used to easily steal parts from other people's projects.


### Copying layout

The above improvement covers copying the schematic from one project to 
another, but we're still without a way to copy the layout, so let's fix 
that as well. The existing copy placement and copy tracks tools area a good 
starting point for this as they do almost exactly what we need. Their 
only shortcoming is that they don't work across projects as they don't 
use the system clipboard.

Starting with the copy tracks tool, it 
occurred to me that it's essentially the same as the regular paste tool 
with the only difference being that it has to calculate the new 
placement with respect to a package rather than allowing the user to 
move things around. So I extended the existing paste tool to cover this 
use case as well and added some other required bits an pieces such as 
copying plane assignments and attaching tracks to packages.


For the new paste placement tool, the existing copy placement tool 
provided a good starting point and only had to be modified to use the 
package placements from the clipboard instead of another group on the 
board.

With these changes, we now have unified way of copying layouts that 
works for groups in the same level of hierarchy, for hierarchical 
blocks and across projects. See [the docs](https://docs.horizon-eda.org/en/latest/copy-layout-placement.html) for a detailed guide on how to use these tools. 


## Plane fragments are saved into a separate file

[Stephie](https://github.com/RX14) brought up that she always clears all 
planes before committing a board so that the repository and diffs are 
not cluttered with the calculated plane fragments and suggested saving 
them to a separate file. That way, one can choose whether to include the calculated planes 
into the repository or not. Since that suggestion made sense to me and 
was of low additional complexity, I implemented it.

For a boards with complex planes, especially with thermals 
enabled, this can significantly reduce the size of the repository as 
the calculated fragments can be about 10Ã— the file size than the rest 
of the board.

## Version 2.4

With all of these improvements and new features, the time is right for  
the next release, [version 2.4 
"Jupiter"](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/releases/tag/v2.4.0). 
See [the 
changelog](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/blob/v2.4.0/CHANGELOG.md) for a list of
all enhancements and bugfixes included in this release.
