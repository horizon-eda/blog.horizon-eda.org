# Pool reload in schematic and board

Since over 3 years, 
[symbol](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/commit/b9035df3e0539fe9925d0cb28eb5b8a0c4785fc7)
and 
[package](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/commit/a8c8cffd0ba80272f1b9814d85c0f2f013459ae0)
editors supported reloading the pool to receive changes made to 
units/pads without restarting the editor. I didn't implement this for 
board an schematic editors right away as reloading all pool items can 
have far-reaching consequences such as deleted pins or gates that cause 
broken references.

Revisiting this, it occurred to me that this the problem is 
already dealt with when opening a board or a schematic. To make use of this 
code, reloading the pool is implemented as serializing the document to 
json in memory, clearing the pool and reconstructing it from the 
temporary json object as if the editor was reopened. This might not be 
the most elegant solution, but it gets the job done with little 
additional complexity.

# Pool update speed improvements

Horizon EDA caches metadata like name and UUID of pool items 
(Parts, Entities, etc.) in a SQLite database for fast and convenient 
lookup. This database has to be kept up to date as the user edits items 
in the pool. Originally, editing a single item required the whole 
database to be rebuilt from scratch as the pool update was 
all-or-nothing. Depending on the machine, that process could take in 
the order of half a minute. This got really annoying as the pool grew bigger, so 
[last 
year](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/commit/0e292f300b656dcc4b3f2f9b78f76f94d0a7cd4a)
I added support for partial pool updates so that only the item (and its 
dependants) that got edited is updated. This made the pool updates 
after edits almost instant.

Still, updating the pool from-scratch, as it's required when 
switching branches, took quite long so I set out to make that process 
faster as well. For the record, updating a pool with about 30000 parts 
took 26 seconds on my machine. My go-to tool for figuring out why my code is 
running slower that I'd like it is 
[perf](https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page) in combination 
with [Hotspot](https://github.com/KDAB/hotspot) to 
produce pretty flame graphs. From the flame graph below, we can easily 
spot that preparing SQLite queries takes its time:

[![pool flame 1](/assets/pool-flame-1.png)](/assets/pool-flame-1.png)

This was quite a [low-hanging fruit]
(https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/commit/28069739a0d79e0df370339956f43c6f2da85f70) since all that's needed is preparing 
the queries once and reusing them afterwards. With this enhancement in 
place, the pool update time is down to 21 seconds and the flame graph looks 
like so:

[![pool flame 2](/assets/pool-flame-2.png)](/assets/pool-flame-2.png)

It might not be directly evident from the flame graph, but each of the 
30000 parts is loaded from disk and parsed 3 times:

 1. During discovery as the dependency graph is built
 2. Actually inserting the part into the pool
 3. Inserting the part's parametric data into the pool

To avoid loading the part from disk in step 2, the json document parsed 
in step 1 is [saved in-memory for later 
usage](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/commit/acb4124e37267a6fed2c3e2fdc5214a017bbac3d).
This optimisation reduced the time needed for a complete update to 18 seconds. [Reusing the 
part](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/commit/b5603e3da80e817418a8116a4cc45bcfbc5f3d42) from step 2 in step 3 shaved off about 
2 seconds, leaving us at 16 seconds.

[![pool flame 3](/assets/pool-flame-3.png)](/assets/pool-flame-3.png)

The pool update itself now is down to executing SQLite queries and 
loading parts from disk once, so there's not much more to do in that regard for 
now. Looking at the UI thread to the right however, it's obvious that 
trying to display (`gtk_label_set_markup`) every filename the pool 
update encounters is taking a lot of CPU time.

Even though having the filenames zip by while the pool updater is doing 
its job may give the user a warm an fuzzy feeling about the computer 
working hard, as it's often portrayed [in 
movies](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewerFriendlyInterface),
actually provides very little benefit since the filenames aren't really 
readable due to only being visible for a fraction of a second.

[Showing only the item type that's currently being worked on in 
combination with improved 
locking](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/commit/bd95955f4f2e4e3a8f12823d3e0cba757dab3cc6)
brings down the pool update to slightly less than 10 seconds, about a
2.5Ã— improvement compared to where we started!

On Windows, where disk 
I/O is known to be slower, the speedup is even more dramatic. Updating 
30000 items went down from 74 seconds to 16 seconds, almost 5 times 
faster than before.

# Rule import/export

For quite some time now users have been 
[asking](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/issues/497) 
for design rule import and export. As written in the issue, this spares 
users from re-entering the board manufacturer's design rules for each 
new board.

During export, only rules that match either a net class, net name regex 
or all nets are exported. Rules that match a net are ignored.

When importing rules, the users gets a chance to match the rules' 
net classes to the ones from the board:

![rules import](/assets/rules-import.png)

To make it easier to tell which rule just got imported and which one 
already was there, the imported rules are decorated with a small 
emblem:

![rules imported](/assets/rules-imported.png)


# Parameter program editor enhancements

The Parameters programs that go with padstacks and packages have always 
been one of the not-so-intuitive aspects of the application. To make 
editing a bit easier, there's now a button to insert the 
`get-parameter` command for a given parameter:

![param win](/assets/param-win.png)

On top of that, the window title now shows the title of the document it 
belongs to avoid confusion if more than one window is opened at a time.

# Navigation buttons for switching layers

My mouse (a trackball in fact) features forward/backward navigation buttons, 
as probably a lot of slightly upmarket pointing devices do as well. 
I've been pondering for a while how these could be put to good use.

Telling a friend of mine about this, he suggested to use them for 
switching layers in the board editor. I quite liked that idea, so now 
there's an option to enable this behaviour.  

# Pick&place export format customisation

When adding the pick&place export in 
[February](https://blog.horizon-eda.org/progress/2020/03/04/progress-2020-02.html#pick--place-export)
, I didn't have any particular export format in mind and decided to wait for 
people to tell me if the export format didn't suit their (or their 
assembly houses) needs. That time came when people made me aware that they had to 
postprocess the generated CSV in Excel to have it accepted by JLCPCB's 
assembly service.

To make their lives easier, the Pick&place output format is now 
customizable to be at least compatible to what JLCPCB expects:

# Drag polygon edge tool

For dragging tracks while keeping their slope, there's the "drag and 
keep slope" tool as well as dragging using the KiCad router. The new 
"drag polygon edge" tool brings this behaviour to polygons by making 
use of the geometry calculations originally developed for the "drag and 
keep slope" tool:

# Interactive pad editing

As suggested in issue 
[#474](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/issues/474#issuecomment-662633414),
the "Edit pad" tool now provides live preview of the changes made in 
the dialog:

Clicking on a pad selects it in the dialog.

# Intel GPU Drivers on Windows

The usual reaction to people complaining about Horizon EDA not running 
well on their particular GPU, especially on Windows, is to tell them that their GPU driver 
sucks by pointing to [this blog 
post](http://richg42.blogspot.com/2014/05/the-truth-on-opengl-driver-quality.html) (guess which one's Intel). 
While this is probably technically correct, it leaves everyone 
involved unhappy.

In one instance, people using Intel GPUs on Windows were reporting that 
the selection preview in the "clarify selection" menu was selecting the 
wrong (in fact, the previous) item on the canvas. With some guesswork involved, I added [a 
workaround](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/commit/db61b4542b8f8abc51e29b50c0a9dac80f0b7e3d)
for this particular problem.

Only after people mentioned, that also text entries updated a frame too late, 
it seemed more and more as if the bug would be with Gtk rather than 
Horizon EDA. So I got hold of an Intel-based laptop running Windows, 
and decided to finally have a closer look at this problem myself. 

Typing in an entry in the board editor window confirmed that the bug 
was indeed real. Typing in a window without a GL area such as the 
preferences window didn't exhibit 
the buggy behaviour. So you might ask, why does a GL area affect 
widgets next to it? Normally, Gtk renders windows entirely in software 
using cairo. For OpenGL, that'd require reading back the rendered 
pixels from GPU memory to main memory using `glReadPixels` which is probably quite slow. To avoid 
this, Gtk uses OpenGL for rendering everything in a window if there's 
at least one GL area. The non-GL widgets receive a cairo context to 
render to as usual. The surface backing this context is then drawn to 
the back buffer as a textured rectangle. GL areas draw onto a 
framebuffer object. When all widgets that needed 
to draw in this cycle are done, the areas in the back buffer that got drawn 
to are copied to the front buffer using the `glBlitFramebuffer` 
function. That's why a having at least one GL area in a window invokes 
different code paths for all widgets.


By now it should be clear, that we've definitely got a Gtk bug on our hands. The 
only thing left to do before filing an issue is to come up with a way 
to reproduce the bug without Horizon EDA attached. Unfortunately, none 
of the examples included in `gtk3-demo` and `gtk3-widget-factory` had 
the right combinations of widgets to make this bug easy to reproduce. 
Rather than implementing a testcase myself, I remembered the 
(undocumented?) [`GDK_GL` environment 
variable](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/blob/gtk-3-24/gdk/gdk.c#L139)
that can be set to `always` to force Gtk to use OpenGL for 
rendering windows even if not actually required by presence of a GL 
area. With the variable set 
accordingly, the bug was reproducible using one of the entry demos from 
`gtk3-demo`, so I filed a [bug 
report](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/issues/3487).

As with the [last OpenGL-on-Windows 
bug](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=789213) I took matters 
into my own hands. The first step obviously is getting Gtk to build. My first attempt at doing so 
failed with an obscure error message hinting about paths or command 
lines being too long. Having also faced this limitation when [building
opencascade on 
Windows](https://github.com/msys2/MINGW-packages/pull/5094) a while 
ago, I recalled that using 
[`SUBST`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUBST) can be used to map 
directories to drive letters. Much to my disappointment, this party 
trick didn't work this time since meson/ninja are too smart and undid 
the drive letter substitution. So I did the obvious but not so 
elegant thing and moved the build directory to `C:\g`. Finally, I was 
able to compile Gtk and run the demos with it. 

Poking at the code by means of copy/pasting snippets around revealed that the bug in the Intel driver could be 
worked around by doing a [`glFlush` and copying the back buffer to the  
front buffer a second 
time](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/issues/3487#note_990986). 
Being too impatient to wait for a new release that'll include 
that workaround, I set up a [workflow using GitHub 
Actions](https://github.com/carrotIndustries/gtk3-horizon) that builds 
Gtk with the workaround included and publishes it on 
[bintray](https://bintray.com/carrotindustries/gtk3-horizon/gtk3-horizon).
These packages are then used in the Windows builds of Horizon EDA.

Shortly after, [Chun-wei Fan](https://gitlab.gnome.org/fanc999) opened 
a [merge 
request](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/merge_requests/2996) for an improved workaround, that 
eventually got 
[merged](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/commit/c87b21351cc63bd10c1e1fb88514d2c5571c3dd6) will be part of Gtk 3.24.25.

Bugs like this and the [other one three years 
ago](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=789213) make me wonder 
if Horizon EDA is the first (or only?) application to make use of Gtk's 
OpenGL features on Windowsâ€¦

# Board rebuild speed

Ever since [day 
0](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/commit/429222a46c13928b8b6da8323c0378c7b0a2028f)
the 
[`Board::expand`](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/blob/429222a46c13928b8b6da8323c0378c7b0a2028f/board/board.cpp#L357)
method has been central to the board editor. Its job is to bring the 
board back into a consistent state after it got modified by a tool. 
These are the major steps in that process:

 - Copying packages from the pool into the board and optionally 
 flipping its layers if placed on the bottom side
 - Assigning nets to pads based on the netlist and propagating nets to 
 tracks
 - Recalculating airwires

To keep implementation complexity low and ensure correctness, all of these steps were done 
after every tool completed. It shouldn't come by surprise that this 
isn't optimal from a performance point of view, especially as boards 
grow more complex.

Some smart person (don't remember who, please [tell 
me](https://blog.horizon-eda.org/comments/) if you know) once said 
something along the lines of

> The best optimisation is to do less

In our case, that requires knowing what a tool modified so that the 
rebuild only recomputes what's necessary. There are two distinct ways 
to accomplish this:

 1. Tools report what needs to be rebuilt when they're done
 2. The data structures in the board record modifications to figure out 
 what needs to be rebuilt after the fact.

My first approach was number 2 as this avoids touching the logic of each 
of the approx. 50 tools relevant to the board editor. However, after 
starting the implementation, this approach felt more and more [Rube 
Goldberg-esque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine).

Instead, I compiled a list of relevant tools and took note of what 
needs to be done after the tool:

![tool list](/assets/tool-list.png)

This found its way into the implementation by adding a couple of more 
bits to the [`ExpandFlags` 
enum](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/blob/master/src/board/board.hpp#L135)
and [setting 
the relevant ones](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/blob/master/src/core/tools/tool_set_via_net.cpp#L68)
right before a tool has done it's job.

Overall, this decreased rebuild times for tools that don't require 
anything in particular to be rebuilt (such as moving a dimension) from 115 ms to 9 ms on the [X-band 
transmitter](https://github.com/carrotIndustries/x-band-tx/). Deleting 
tracks of big nets such as GND only went down to around 60 ms, as this still 
requires recomputing airwires for the entire GND net.

Even though I paid close attention to not forget any edge cases, there's 
still the possibility that I forgot some interactions. Don't 
hesitate to get in touch if you notice things not updating anymore after 
certain tools.

# Git tab performance

While reviewing [Stephanie's pull 
request](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon-pool/pull/175) that 
adds more than 10000 new parts, I noticed that the Git tab took 
unacceptably long to load, freezing the UI for more than 10 seconds. 

Profiling revealed that a substantial amount of time is taken by the 
[`GtkTreeModelSort`](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkTreeModelSort.html)
adapter responding to the items inserted into the store backing the 
treeview that lists the diff to the `master` branch. As I couldn't figure 
out a way to prevent `GtkTreeModelSort` from updating until all items 
are inserted, I tried deleting it before inserting thousands of items 
and recreating it afterwards. Even though this reduced the time to 
about 4 seconds, that solution seemed somewhat hacky to me. Instead, I 
ditched `GtkTreeModelSort` altogether and moved all of the sorting and 
filtering to a temporary SQLite table. This reduced the load time to slightly less than 3 
seconds.

Profiling indicates that the majority of the time is now taken by 
libgit2 creating the diff. Blocking to the UI for 3 seconds still is 
far from optimal, but reviewing pull requests will more than 
10000 items isn't something a lot of users will often do. That's why I haven't 
yet bothered to move the git interaction into a background thread.

# Improved arc rendering

Due to perceived implementation effort (me being lazy) arcs were 
rendered as series of line segments. This had the unfortunate 
consequence that in outline mode arcs looked like the one on the left 
side. Not really what one would call "outline. To improve their 
appearance, the OpenGL renderer now renders arcs natively, as shown on 
the right side.

![arc old](/assets/arc-old.png) ![arc new](/assets/arc-new.png)

To to so, it draws a equilateral triangle that's large enough to 
contain the arc and then uses the [fragment 
shader](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/blob/master/src/canvas/shaders/triangle-arc-fragment.glsl) to turn the triangle 
into the desired arc.


# What's next

As per the [release 
schedule](https://blog.horizon-eda.org/misc/2020/03/26/release-schedule.html),
version 1.4 is due end of January. I decided not to attend the (virtual) FOSDEM 
this year, instead I'll try to write some more blog posts.
