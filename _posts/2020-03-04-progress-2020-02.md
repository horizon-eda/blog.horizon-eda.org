Quite a lot has happened since the 1.0 release, so I decided to do a 
writeup similar to how [other projects do it](https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/).

# List unplaced gates in schematic editor

Many users have been asking how they place the remaining symbols of an 
entity if they didn't place all of them initially. This is most likely 
caused by there being no visual indication of the unplaced symbols.

To alleviate this, the schematic editor now lists all unplaced symbols 
similar to how the symbol editor lists unplaced pins.

As a bonus, the board editor now also shows all unplaced packages.


# Save layer settings separately

At FOSDEM, people from KiCad and LibrePCB were mentioning that they're 
planning to save layer visibility and other settings that aren't really 
part of the design itself to a separate file rather than including them 
in the board file itself. This helps to make diffs easier to read and 
keeps design and non-design data separate.

Since that made sense to me as well, I implemented it by storing what 
was previously at the `_imp` key in the `board.json` file in 
`board.json.imp_meta`.


# Refactor Core class

The `Core` class used to be horizon's way to access different document types 
(schematic, board, symbol, etc.) in a unified fashion. Unfortunately, 
that class accumulated quite a lot of baggage in the last years as it 
also hosts the tools and provides the property interface. Thus every 
part of the application that needed unified access also pulled in quite 
a lot of dependencies.

To fix this, the decision was made to introduce a family of interface 
classes `IDocument`, `IDocumentSchematic`, etc. that only provide the 
unified access and nothing else. The `Core` classes then in turn 
implement these interfaces so most code can stay as-is. Since the tools 
lost access to the `Core` to do `commit()` and `revert()` the 
`ToolResponse` class has been extended so that tools can use their 
return value to signal commit or revert. This also helps to emphasize 
that commit or revert is the end of a tool's lifecycle.

If all went well, this should have no user-facing effects.

# Unify project title and title blocks

More by accident than intent, the project's name could be set in the 
project itself and in the schematic's title blocks with no link between 
these two. [ataoav](https://github.com/atoav) [came up with some 
ideas](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/issues/330) to improve 
the situation. After some discussion, we settled on moving all metadata 
to the netlist and having the project manager pick it up as well. This 
also enabled using these variables in texts on the board as well, so 
you'll only need to set the board's revision in the schematic editor 
and it can be used on the board as well.

As a bonus, we finally have the project's title in all window titles.

# Pick & place export

Pick & place export has been on my to-do list for quite some time. 
Finally some users were asking for it, so I implemented it. As to be 
expected this was rather straight forward as it's conceptually similar 
to the already existing BOM export.

![pnp export](/assets/pnp-export.png)

The biggest hurdle was to figure out the proper reference angle for 
components placed on the bottom side. After asking on
[mikrocontroller.net](https://www.mikrocontroller.net/topic/489930) and 
on the [EEVBlog 
Forum](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/eda/pickplace-files-component-rotation-on-the-bottom-side/)
I settled on my initial implementation that mirrored components at the 
X-axis to arrive at the 0Â° orientation for parts on the bottom side. 
This is contrary to how mirroring works in Horizon EDA itself but is 
the same as in KiCad and Altium.

People in these threads also mentioned that since there's no standard 
for pick & place files, assembly houses usually take care to match the 
pick & place data to the assembly drawing.

# Airwire filter

In the early phases of board layout there are usually quite a lot of 
airwires that might make it difficult to see what's going on. To 
provide, a more focused view, the airwire filter makes it possible to 
hide airwires of select nets.

# View hints

With the addition of the airwire filter, there are now three ways that 
alter the behaviour of the editor without any indication that's 
directly visible:
  - Selection filter
  - Airwire filter
  - Bottom view

To address this, the interactive manipulator now shows a message in 
status bar if any of these three are active:

# Touchscreen gestures

When using a touch-enabled laptop, I've found myself reaching for the 
touch screen quite often for zooming and panning actions as it's 
quicker than using the touchpad.  So I wanted to have this convenience 
in Horizon EDA as well!

Fortunately, Gtk has kept on with the times and supports all the usual 
pan, zoom and rotate gestures out of the box. The only thing left to do 
is to make the events generated by these gestures do the right 
thing to the canvas. That's why this only required about 100 lines of code each
for the 2D (board, schematic, etc.) and 3D canvas.

Since showing these gestures without the hand in frame doesn't make much sense, 
I recorded a short video of me aimlessly zooming and panning around. 
Sorry for the potato quality, but that's what I got out of my 2011
point&shoot camera after compressing the video to a sensible file 
size. At least I got rid of glare and reflections.

<video muted controls width="100%">
  <source src="/assets/touch.mp4">
</video>

Even if this feature might not see much use in the wild, it's still 
something cool to show off. To my best knowledge, this makes Horizon 
EDA the first (and only?) full-featured PCB design software that 
supports touchscreen gestures.

# Detecting URLs in text

As I found out, users like to place links to datasheets, appnotes an 
other related literature in schematics. Up until this point, opening 
the link involved awkwardly selecting the URL and pasting it into a 
browser. 

To make this easier, the schematic editor recognizes URLs and shows a 
clickable link in the head-up display (the black box is the link's 
tooltip). A bit of CSS was necessary to make the link easier to read 
against the dark background.

# Support for unplaced components

There are many good reasons for having components in the design that have 
their footprint on the board, but won't be populated, such as encoding 
revisions or future-proofing. To reliably track these across BOM, 
pick&place file and other formats, it's preferable that this is 
supported by the design tool rather than manually editing files after 
the fact or repurposing component values.

[eqvinox](https://github.com/eqvinox) saw the need for this feature and 
opened a [pull 
request](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/pull/347) that adds 
support for marking components as "do not place" in the 
schematic/netlist. Other parts of the application can then pick this up 
and act accordingly such as not adding the part to the BOM. After 
around 10 days, that PR was ready to be merged. Here's a screenshot of 
how unplaced components are displayed in the schematic:

![no populate](/assets/nopop.png)

All in all, the PR amounted to about 300 lines changed (251 additions, 66 deletions).
This made me wonder why other EDA software around for many decades 
doesn't support unplaced components as it's a rather low hanging 
fruit...

# Improved search

In its initial implementation, the search only supported searching for 
objects identifiable by a single UUID and only looked for reference 
designators in symbols. That didn't allow for searching for pin names 
or MPN. Apart from these user-facing shortcomings, the search logic was 
implemented in the `Core` since it was convenient at that time but 
isn't strictly necessary since the search logic only needs access to 
the document.

To improve on these two aspects, the search logic got factored into its 
own class `Searcher` with the appropriate subclasses such as 
`SearcherBoard` that actually perform the search. Searching 
for MPN  in symbols got possible by the `Searcher` class now defining its own set of types that the user 
can pick from. Searching for pins and pads got possible by making 
`SearchResult` refer to the found thing by `UUIDPath<2>` that can store 
both the symbol and pin UUID.

For the user, all of this mostly manifests in a longer list of object 
types to pick from:

![search](/assets/search.png)

As it's evident from the commit history implementing this didn't go 
without any bumps in the road. For the second (?) time in this project, 
I fell victim to the 
[static initialization order 
fiasco](https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/ctors#static-init-order) that 
occurs when a constructor for a static object depends on another static 
object being initialized since that constructors for static 
objects get called in is undefined. This first went unnoticed, since 
the stars aligned just right and the constructor order ended up such 
that all static objects could be constructed.

Only when a Windows user 
complained that the interactive manipulator didn't start anymore, this 
got my attention. After confirming that this was indeed the case on 
Windows, I tried to debug this using gdb still oblivious to the root 
cause. The exception occuring before `main()` as verified by setting a 
breakpoint then gave the hint to have a closer at look at 
newly-introduced static objects. Staring at 
[the](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/blob/819687c46b466a3621cf6c4ffc9b7fa98ae564ee/src/imp/search/searcher.hpp#L23)
[code](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/blob/819687c46b466a3621cf6c4ffc9b7fa98ae564ee/src/imp/search/searcher.cpp#L21)
revealed that the constructor for `Searcher::TypeInfo` had a dependency 
on `object_descriptions`. Once the cause of the crash was now clear 
[fixing it](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/commit/ce0833c78e4241aaad5a057ad95cf81ff1ce10cb)
merely involved constructing the `type_info` map on first use as 
suggested by the [ISO C++ 
FAQ](https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/ctors#construct-on-first-use-v2).

# What's next?

Can't tell. Development will go on as usual based on what's on my mind 
and issues that crop up.
