# Show check result in remote/git tab

The introduction of the [poolbot](https://blog.horizon-eda.org/progress/2020/10/29/progress-2020-09-10.html#pull-request-review-bot) made reviewing pull requests to 
the default pool significantly easier as it provides an overview of 
all items in the PR and lists all of their check results. Still, 
it's up to the submitter to make sure that all checks have passed 
before creating the PR. To make their lives easier, 
[Juergen](https://github.com/jue89) [suggested](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/issues/553)
adding the check results to the pool manager itself. Having also 
thought about this very feature, I went ahead and implemented it. For 
completeness, the git tab in the pool manager shows the check results 
as well.

# Parametric data in schematic   

To clearly communicate design intent, it's good practice to include 
relevant attributes such as capacitor's rated DC voltage or a resistor's 
tolerance in the schematic. In Horizon EDA much of that information is already 
available in part's parametric data. 

With custom values on symbols, there now is an easy way to add 
parametric data to the schematic:

Apart from the Group&tag display, this feature is the main reason 
to make sure that multi-line value text on symbols doesn't overlap with 
the symbol body.

# KiCad package importer window

Ever since the package editor supported importing KiCad packages, some 
users had trouble finding it as it was hidden in the package editor's 
hamburger menu. To make it easier to find, it got it's own button in 
the pool manager's package tab similar to the KiCad symbol import 
wizard.

The import window also makes selecting the right package easier as it 
provides an instant preview of what's to be imported:

# Cursor in tools

A friend of mine using Horizon EDA for his first board layout told me 
that he had difficulties telling if some tools such as draw line or 
route track were active as they provide very little visual feedback 
other than the bar at the bottom of the canvas when not having started 
a line/track. He suggested changing the cursor to reflect the current 
tool as it's standard among many graphics-related applications.

I settled on replacing the system's cursor in that case as it isn't all 
that useful after all in tools since they only operate on the grid-based 
canvas cursor. To ensure optimum visibility regardless of background 
color, the tool's icon is rendered with a white border. This is 
accomplished by creating a mask from the icon outline and rendering it 
offset by ±1px in both axis. The idea for this came from Gtk's code for 
drawing shadows on icons based on CSS properties.

Here's how it looks like on a ×2 scale:

# Part wizard package preview

In [issue #566](https://github.com/horizon-eda/horizon/issues/566) 
[MarSik](https://github.com/MarSik) suggested showing the the package 
in the part wizard. After a bit of clarification, this made sense to 
me, so the part wizard now looks like so:

Selecting a pad in the list will highlight it in the package preview.

# 3D preview

## Picking

I though it'd be useful if one could click on a package in the 3D 
preview and find more about it, such as reference designator and part 
number. For this, we first need to figure out which package is at a given 
pixel position. In the context of 3D rendering, this is often referred 
to as picking.

There are two ways this can be done: One involves casting a ray 
from the cursor position and figuring out which of the 3D models the 
ray intersects with. This has the downside that all of the model 
placement and transformation has to be redone in software and has a chance of 
not matching what's on screen. Wouldn't it be nice if we could reuse 
the transformations the GPU is doing anyhow? Turns out we can by 
attaching another colour buffer to the framebuffer and [rendering each 
package with a distinct 
colour](http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/miscellaneous/clicking-on-objects/picking-with-an-opengl-hack/).
In our case, the aforementioned colour isn't really one with R, G and B 
components, but rather an unsigned 16 bit integer. As models are 
rendered using instancing, we get this distinct colour almost for free 
from `gl_InstanceID`. All that's needed is adding an offset for each 
model to tell them apart. For illustration, this is what the pick buffer looks like for a 
simple board:

![ ](/assets/3d-pick.png)

Once the GPU has rendered the board, the pick buffer is downsampled (can't 
read from multisample buffers) and read back using `glReadPixels`. Since 
`glReadPixels` can be slow, the pick buffer is only read if the user 
actually clicks on something, so zooming and panning stays smooth. With 
the pick buffer in main memory, all that's left to do is get the value 
at the coordinate and look up which package it belongs to.

Details on the currently selected package are displayed in a head-up 
display style similar to the board editor:

## Model alignment

When adding support for importing STEP models, I was initially hesitant 
to add support for translating (and rotating) the model as I feared 
that users will eyeball these rather than taking measurements on the 
model itself, resulting in inaccurate model placement.

The recommended, probably not documented, way to place the model instead is to use a proper 3D 
CAD tool such as FreeCAD and place the model by aligning its features 
to the origin. Apart from introducing another tool into the workflow, 
modifying vendor-provided models means that other users downloading the 
model now have to replicate the placement on their end.

By now, it should be clear that we want to be able to align 3D models 
in Horizon EDA itself without the use of external software. The first 
step in this process is picking points from the 3D model. To do so, we 
need to extract corners from the model and make them selectable on 
screen. Extracting the corners got implemented as part of the STEP 
importer as it's already traversing the model's geometry. Once
extracted, the points are rendered with a slight depth offset added in the fragment 
shader to make sure that they appear on top of the model. To make the 
points selectable by clicking, the picking infrastructure described above then got extended to also support 
picking points.

Aligning the model is a two-step process. First, the user enters the 
from coordinates, either by picking a single point or two points to get 
their average value for centering models.  Second, they enter and 
select where the previously entered point should be at after moving.


## Axes arrows

Using the model alignment feature for while, it quickly became 
imminent that there's the need for the user to see which axis is 
pointing in which direction. In fact, most if not all CAD or modelling 
applications have some sort of XYZ arrows for this purpose. The ones from blender struck me 
as particularly well done and nice to look at:

![ ](/assets/ax-blender.png)

About 100 lines of code later, the 3D preview has something that looks 
roughly the same.

Since the arrows look roughly like lollipops, the widget is called 
`AxesLollipop`.

## Projection

As hinted in the last progress report, I did some experiments with [Open CASCADE's hidden line removal 
algorithm](https://dev.opencascade.org/doc/overview/html/occt_user_guides__modeling_algos.html#occt_modalg_10)
for projecting 3D models. With the hard work of dealing wih Open 
CASCADE done, the the only missing piece was to hook up the code to the 
3D preview and the package editor.

With this feature in place, clicking on the Project button, takes us 
from this

to that.

To aid drawing the outline, the corners and arc centers of the 
projection are targets that tools can snap to.


# STEP export speed improvements

Exporting moderately large board as a STEP model, I noticed that the 
exporter was taking surprisingly long to create the board body.  It's 
constructed by extruding the board outline to a prism and then 
subtracting cutouts and holes. Holes for example were represented as 
cylinders. On top of that, it took one call to Open CASCADE to 
process every negative feature. By this description, it should be 
obvious that doing the subtraction 3D isn't strictly necessary as the 
final shape also is a prism with holes that could as well be created by 
extruding a face with holes.

Having gained a bit more understanding of Open CASCADE from the 
other recent 3D model related features, I implemented exactly this. In that process, I also 
discovered that Open CASCADE supports subtracting an arbitrary number 
of shapes in one go, potentially making use of multi threading.  These 
optimisations, most likely the second one, decreased the export time 
from over 100 seconds to about 3 seconds. Even tough such a dramatic 
improvement is nice, it's also kind of embarrassing since it was that 
slow to begin with. 

# Treeview/paned state store

After all of the shiny new 3D features, now over to something much more 
mundane. I've found it difficult to determine default layouts for list 
views and paned widgets that work in all cases, so after opening the 
pool manager or similar views, I've often found myself readjusting 
column widths and splitter positions to my liking. To make Horizon 
EDA look [less stupid](http://hallofshame.gp.co.at/stupid.htm), these 
are now stored persistently in an SQLite database similar to the window 
positions.
